Ira Glass
This spring my friend, Etgar, was visiting the United States. He's Israeli. And we went to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City to see this exhibit by this artist named Cindy Sherman. And this very strange thing happened that we didn't know what to make of it. It was truly a mystery. And I invited Etgar here onto the radio show to talk about it. We recorded this conversation a few days ago when I was still getting over a cold. So you'll hear that my voice is a little croaky in this recording.

Ira Glass
So I've been thinking about how to describe the exhibit. Do you want to describe it?

Etgar Keret
No, no. I think you will describe it better.

Ira Glass
OK. Well, basically, Cindy Sherman-- she photographs herself as hundreds of different people. And to say that-- if you haven't seen these pictures, just to get it across, she's utterly and completely transformed in them. And some of them-- they look like old movie stills. And some on them-- they look like Renaissance paintings. And some of them are super bright garish colors. And in some she's beautiful. And in some she's grotesque. And in some she's this composed matronly lady. And the way I remember the story is that you and I were walking into the third room of this exhibit. So we had seen two rooms of these things.

Etgar Keret
I think that it was about the time when I realized that it was her in all the photos. Because before that I thought it was different people.

Ira Glass
Right, right. And then you said, oh wait. It's all the same person? And then a woman came over to us.

Etgar Keret
And she said that she is Cindy Sherman.

Ira Glass
Yeah. And--

Etgar Keret
And that she comes to the exhibit every day to see how people react to it.

Ira Glass
And so she-- if I had to describe her, I'd say that she looked like she was about 55 or 60, wire rim glasses, gray hair.

Etgar Keret
Yes. She looked to me like a pretty well educated upper middle class lady who likes books.

Ira Glass
Yeah. Looking at her, thinking that she might be Cindy Sherman, I thought if you were to try to put on a costume to exactly blend in with the crowd at the Museum of Modern Art, this is the costume.

Etgar Keret
But the thing about it is that when you see the Cindy Sherman photos, you will realize that she can look as old or as young or as beautiful or as ugly as she wants. So I just, as I spoke to her, I looked at the photos around me. And the range of appearance that were in them kind of-- I said, OK, this woman could be one of those photos.

Ira Glass
And I remember-- like I did the same thing. I was looking at the pictures on the wall. And I was looking at her face. And I was trying to think, could this be her face. And I was just trying to get her to stay there and keep talking to us so I could figure this out. Were you also trying to keep her there talking to us? Was that your experience of it too?

Etgar Keret
No. My experience was that oh, Ira is so excited. And kind of thinking maybe I'm missing something. Or maybe Ira is gone crazy. But I never saw you so excited.

Ira Glass
You never saw me so excited?

Etgar Keret
No, no. Maybe this says something about our relationship. Maybe you are always excited. But just went I'm around, you become this kind of cold fish.

Ira Glass
I'm a really good friend. Yeah. And so I guess that I noticed that she was getting a little bit put off by my interest. And then she said to us, oh, I'm not really Cindy Sherman. And I took that as oh, she is Cindy Sherman. But she has to end this conversation. That's it. She's had enough of me. And did you take it as she's not Cindy Sherman? Or did you just think she was trying to get away from us?

Etgar Keret
No. Later I thought to myself that if I would pretend to be Cindy Sherman, the last thing I would do would be to tell people I'm not Cindy Sherman. I would be too embarrassed to say in the end I'm not Cindy Sherman. So I kind of thought in the end, like after she had left, that she probably was Cindy Sherman.

Ira Glass
I agree. To me it made her very credibly Cindy Sherman.

Etgar Keret
Yeah. And it was also like be about the nature of the exhibit. Because she's a woman with 100 personas coming with her 101 persona. And I would say that even if she wasn't, I think it would be smart of the museum to hire women who would go around and say that they are Cindy Sherman.

Ira Glass
I thought about this for weeks after it happened. And I really did not know what to think. You know if it wasn't Cindy Sherman, if it was not her in a way, the whole thing is even better. If there is some Upper East Side 55, 60-year-old lady who just walks up to people in the Museum of Modern Art and claims to be Cindy Sherman, I love that lady. I love the balls on that lady. That is somebody embracing life. For Etgar, when we talked about this on tape, he surprised me by insisting that it is better not to now. He said it is a better experience to just never find out the truth.

Etgar Keret
Look. I can walk you through all the scenarios, OK? A, she is Cindy Sherman. She says I'm Cindy Sherman. You say hey, Etgar, can you take a photo in your iPhone of me with Cindy Sherman? This is the one experience. The second experience-- she says, I'm not Cindy Sherman. I'm just a bored woman who's into harassing people in exhibit. We say to her go away, woman. And we throw things at her. And she goes away. Or c, she says I'm Cindy Sherman. No, I'm not Cindy Sherman. And we still contemplate about that. I think that from the three options, this is the most interesting and exciting one. And we got our money worth. You know, we went. We saw a show. We met a woman. She said she's Cindy Sherman. She said she wasn't Cindy Sherman. We still don't know if she is or she isn't. I mean I wish all exhibitions were like that.

Ira Glass
I'm going to get Cindy Sherman. I've set up a phone call to speak with Cindy Sherman about this.

Etgar Keret
Leave poor Cindy alone. Why do you want to put her in that spot? I think it's not going to clarify anything.

Ira Glass
Because you're saying that she might lie either way.

Etgar Keret
Because I'm saying if it was Cindy Sherman, then she had already lied. And if it wasn't Cindy Sherman, then Cindy Sherman could still lie.

Cindy Sherman
Hello.

Ira Glass
Hey. Is this Cindy Sherman?

Cindy Sherman
Yes.

Ira Glass
Cindy, it's Ira Glass.

Cindy Sherman
Hi. I'm so sorry about yesterday. I feel like I'm always--

Ira Glass
I reached Cindy Sherman this week. She's saying she's sorry right there. Because she accidentally forgot our phone appointment on Tuesday. And I'm only playing you that part of the recording to give you a sense of what an utterly normal, straightforward, undeceptive person she seemed like on the telephone. And I told her the whole story of the woman who walked up to me and Etgar at the Museum of Modern Art.

Cindy Sherman
Wow.

Ira Glass
So was that you?

Cindy Sherman
Not at all. Oh my god. But I'd love to know who she is or-- I mean-- if this person really comes every day. Or I mean I've just vaguely fantasized about being in the exhibit while the public's there. But then what always sort of complete turned me off of it is any particular moment that somebody would suddenly realize it was me-- that would just freak me out.

Ira Glass
Do you like the idea that she did this?

Cindy Sherman
Yeah. I think it's great. I wonder-- I really do wonder if she does it a lot or if it was just some, like, fluke thing where she just thought oh, I'm going to play with this guy. Maybe once you air this, other people will have other--

Ira Glass
Sightings.

Cindy Sherman
Yeah, right.

Ira Glass
That didn't even occur to me. Right, yeah. Let me just say, like, if you're hearing this interview and this has happened to you, please go to our website and be in touch.

Cindy Sherman
That would be so interesting.

Ira Glass
OK. So she is not part of the show.

Cindy Sherman
No.

Ira Glass
You did not hire her, put her up to it?

Cindy Sherman
No, no.

Ira Glass
Do you have a message for this lady if we find her?

Cindy Sherman
No.

Ira Glass
OK.

Cindy Sherman
I mean she should do it more often. Yeah. What would be funny is if more people were going around, pretending.

Ira Glass
Potential fake Cindy Sherman's and victims of fake Cindy Sherman's, please note. The exhibit moves to San Francisco in July. Well today on our program, Switcharoo, pretending to be somebody or something you are not. Sometimes that's perfectly fine, perfectly innocent, hurts no one. Sometimes it is not that at all. And sometimes it is really hard to tell. From WBEX Chicago, it's This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.

Act One. Healthy Start.

Ira Glass
Act One, Healthy Start. So my friend, Etgar, is somebody whose work is actually here on the radio show from time to time. That's how I got to know him. Etgar Keret is his name. He writes short fiction here in the program. And he's thought a lot about this subject, about the pleasure of pretending to be someone else. And he has this short story. It's read for us by an actor. Because Etgar always prefers that somebody read his stories on the radio show whose English is easier to understand. Here it is.

John Connolly
Every night in the months after she had left him, he'd fall asleep in a different spot-- on the sofa, in an armchair in the living room, on the mat in the balcony like some homeless bum. Every morning he made a point of going out for breakfast. Even prisoners get a daily walk in the yard, don't they? At the cafe, they always gave him a table set for two and sat him across from an empty chair-- always, even when the waiter specifically asked him if he was alone.

Other people would be sitting there in twos or threes, laughing, or tasting each others food, or fighting over the check, while Myron sat by himself eating his healthy start-- orange juice, muesli with honey, decaf double espresso with warm low fat milk on the side. Of course it would have been nicer if someone were sitting down across from him and laughing with him, if there had been someone to argue with over the check. And he'd have had to struggle to hand the money to the waitress, saying don't take it from him. Avery, put it back. This one's on me. But he didn't really have anyone to do that with. And breakfast alone was 100 times better than staying home.

Myron spend a lot of time eying the other tables. He'd eavesdrop on conversations, read the sports supplement, or examine the ups and downs of the Israeli shares on Wall Street with an air of detached concern. Sometimes someone would come over and ask for a section of the paper he'd finished reading. And he would nod and try to smile. Once when a sexy young mother with a baby and a stroller walked over to him, he even said to her as he gave up the front page with the banner headline about a gang rape in the suburbs, what a crazy world we're bringing our children into. He thought it sounds like a kind of statement that brings people closer together, pointing as it did to their common fate. But the sexy mom just glared at him and took the Healthy Living supplement too without asking.

Then one Thursday, a fat sweaty guy walked into the cafe and smiled at him. Myron was caught off guard. The last person who'd given him a smile was Maian just before she had left him five months earlier. And her smile had been unmistakably sarcastic. Whereas this one was soft, almost apologetic. The fat guy gestured something, apparently a signal that he'd like to sit down. And Myron nodded almost without thinking. The fat guy took a seat.

Rube, he said. Listen, I'm really sorry I'm late. I know we said 10. But I had a nightmare morning with the kid. It crossed Myron's mind that maybe he ought to tell the fat guy he wasn't Ruben. But he found himself checking his watch instead and saying what's 10 minutes? Forget it. Then neither of them spoke for a second. And Myron asked if the kid was OK.

And the fat guy said she was. It was just said she'd started a new kindergarten. And every time he took are there, she had a hard time letting him go. But never mind. He stopped short. You've got enough on your plate without my problems. Let's get down to business. Myron took a deep breath and waited. Look, the fat guy said. 500's too high. Give it to me for 400. Know what? 410 even. And I'm good for 600 pieces. 480, Myron said. And that's only if you're good for 1,000.

You got to understand, the fat guy said. The market's in the crapper, what with the recession and all. Just last night on the news they showed people eating out of garbage cans. If you keep pushing, I'll have to sell high. You're pricing me right out of the market. Don't worry, Myron told him. For every three people eating out of garbage cans, there's someone driving a Mercedes. This made the fat guy laugh out loud. They told me you were tough, he muttered with a smile. I'm just like you, Myron protested, simply trying to keep body and soul together.

The fat guy wiped his sweaty palm on his shirt and then held it out. 460, he said. 460 and I take 1,000. When he saw Myron wasn't reacting, he added 460, 1,000 pieces. And I owe you a favor. And you know better than anyone, Ruben, that in our business favors are worth more than money. This last sentence was all Myron needed to take the outstretched hand and shake it. For the first time in his life someone told him a favor, someone who thought his name was Rubin, but still. And when they had finished eating, as they argued over who would pick up the tab, a warm feeling spread through Myron's stomach. He beat the fat guy to it by 1/10 of a second and shoved the crumpled bill into the waitresses hand.

From that day on it became practically a standard procedure. Myron would take a seat, give his order, and keep a lookout for any new person who came into the cafe. And if that person started searching the tables with an expectant look, Myron would quickly wave and invite him or her to take a seat. I don't want this to end up in court, a bald guy with thick eyebrows told him. Me neither, Myron conceded. It's always better to settle things amicably. Just remember, I don't do night shifts, a Botox-lipped bleached blond announced. Just what do you expect? Everyone else'll do night shifts except you, Myron grumbled back.

Gabby asked me to tell you that he's sorry, said a guy with rotting teeth and an earring. It he was really sorry, Myron countered, he should have come and told me himself, no middlemen. In your email you sounded taller, a skinny redhead complained. In your email, you sounded less picky, Myron snapped. And somehow everything worked out in the end. He and baldy settled out of court. Botox lips agreed to ask her sister to babysit so she could do one night shift a week. Rotting teeth promised Gabby would phone. And the redhead and Myron agreed they weren't quite right for each other.

Sometimes they picked up the tab. Sometimes he did. With the redhead, they split the bill. And it was all so fascinating that if a whole morning went by when nobody took a seat across from him at the table, Myron felt let down. Luckily this didn't happen too often. Almost two months had gone by since the sweaty fat guy when a pock marked man walked in. Despite the pocked face and the fact that he looked at least 10 years older than Myron, he was good looking, loads of charisma.

The first thing he said as he sat down was I was sure you wouldn't show. But we agreed to meet, Myron answered. Yes, said the pock marked guy with a sad smile. Except that after the way I yelled at you on the phone, I was afraid you'd chicken out. So here I am, Myron said, almost teasingly. I'm sorry I yelled at you on the phone, the guy apologized. Really. I just lost it. But I meant every word I said. You got that? I'm asking you to stop seeing her. But I love her, Myron said in a choked voice.

Sometimes you can love something. And you still have to give it up, the pock marked guy said. Listen to someone a little older than you. Sometimes you have to give it up. Sorry, Myron said. But I can't. Yes you can, the guy shot back. You can. And you will. There's no other way. Maybe we both love her. But I happen to be her husband. And I am not about to let you break up my family. Got that?

Myron shook his head. You have no idea what my life has been like this past year, he told the husband. Hell-- not even hell, just one great big stale chunk of nothing. And when you've been living with nothing for so long and suddenly something turns up, you can't just tell it to go away. You understand me, don't you? I know you understand me.

The husband bit his lower lip. If you see her one more time, he said, I'll kill you. I'm not kidding. And you know it. So kill me, Myron shrugged. That doesn't scare me. We're all going to die in the end. The husband bent down across the table and socked Myron in the jaw. It was the first time in his life that anyone had hit him so hard. And Myron felt the hot wave of pain surge up somewhere in the middle of his face and spread in every direction.

Seconds later he found himself on the floor with a husband standing over him. I'll take her away from here, the husband kept shouting as he went on kicking Myron in the stomach and ribs. I'll take her far away to another country. And you won't know where she is. You'll never see her again. You got that, you rotten piece of [BLEEP]. Two waiters jumped the husband and managed somehow to yank him away from Myron. Somebody yelled to the bar man to call the police.

With his cheek still glued to the coolness of the floor, Myron watched the husband run out of the cafe. One of the waiters bent over and asked him if he was OK. And Myron made an attempt to answer. Do you want me to call an ambulance, the waiter asked. Myron whispered that he didn't. Are you sure, the waiter insisted. You're bleeding.

Myron nodded slowly and shut his eyes. He tried as hard as he could to imagine himself with that woman, the one he'd never see again. He tried. And for a moment he almost succeeded. His whole body ached. He felt alive.

Ira Glass
Actor John Connolly, reading a story by Etgar Keret from his new collection of stories, Suddenly a Knock on the Door. So I don't know if this can be redundant or not. And there wasn't time for it in the radio broadcast of this episode of our show. But here on the podcast and in the online versions, we can go past 59 minutes. And I first read this short story, Healthy Start, I don't know, maybe a year ago. And we knew we'd be preparing it for this week's show and all that. And it was all planned. And then it wasn't until I talked to Etgar on tape for this week's show that he told me that the story was based on a real incident.

Etgar Keret
You know this story came from a real true story. But here's--

Ira Glass
What?

Etgar Keret
Yeah. You want me to tell you the story?

Ira Glass
Yeah.

Etgar Keret
Well the thing is that I was in Berlin teaching for a semester. And I was lonely as a dog. It was raining. I didn't know anybody. And then one day my journal publisher, who's based in Munich, said that he's coming to Berlin. And he wants to meet me. So he gave me a name of a cafe. And then I went to that cafe. And I saw that the cafe was like the size of a football stadium, you know? And I said how the hell am I going to find this guy. I don't even know how he looks like.

So I took a table that was just facing the door. And I said, OK. I'm going to wait. And all kinds of people came. About some of them I said maybe that's him, maybe that's him. But then this guy came. And I saw that he was looking with his eyes somebody, as if he was looking for a guy he's supposed to meet. So I waved him. And he came. And he sat in front of me. And he started speaking to me in English, which is a good sign, because this is Germany.

And he said I couldn't sleep all night. And I said to him, why? And he said I was thinking about your email. And you know it flattered me, you know. Because he's my publisher. He takes me seriously. But when I thought about it, what I wrote in the email is that I couldn't make it 10:30. I could only come at 11. And then so I said to him, and? And he said, and I can't give you 300,000 euros. I can only give you 250,000. But I have them here in cash. Only you have to show me the goods first.

And then I looked at him. And I said to him, Gil? And he looked at me and he said Samir? And I said this kind of whoops. And he said to me oh, I'm sorry. And he had this big bag, which seemed very heavy. And he took his big bag. And he said some words--

Ira Glass
Etgar says that soon enough the German publisher shows up and recognizes Etgar by his author photo, and sits right down. And Etgar says that he cannot concentrate on the conversation at all. All he can think about is what he should have said to that guy before.

Etgar Keret
And I thought to myself all the time what would've happened if I just said to him OK. I'm OK with the 250,000 euros. But what's this I want to check the goods first? Did I ask you to see the money first? if you don't trust me, don't do business with me. And I went with this sentence in my head home. And I got home. I wrote the story.

Act Two. Forgive us our Press Passes.

Ira Glass
Act Two, Forgive us Our Press Passes. You know how when you call someplace for customer service, and you're on some 800 number, and somebody answers the phone and says her name is Jill, and at some point the thought crosses your mind-- this person's name is probably not Jill. This person is probably sitting in a call center in India or somewhere. And you have that thought, what other jobs can we possibly outsource to people far away at this point? Well Sarah Koenig tells this story of a fairly recent addition to the list of jobs.

Sarah Koenig
Back in November, a newspaper reporter named Ryan Smith got an assignment from his editor. Write up a student of the week story for the Houston Chronicle. The student was a senior at Bellaire High School outside Houston.

Ryan Smith
So I ended up calling the high school. And it was kind of interesting. Because I talked to the principal a little bit. He was sort of vetting me. And he's like, well why don't you just come by the school tomorrow? And--

Sarah Koenig
Why is this even vaguely funny to Ryan? Because Ryan doesn't work for the Houston Chronicle. he's never read the Houston Chronicle. He's never been to Houston. He's never been to Texas. When he made that phone call, he was sitting more than 1,000 miles away in the Midwest. But, of course, the principal of Bellaire High School can't be expected to know that. He probably pictured the newspaper business the way most of us picture it, that Ryan was from the area, that he worked at some crummy office, drove around in a beat up Honda Civic to cover local stories.

Ryan Smith
And it was a little awkward for me. Because here I am in Chicago. And he's assuming that I'm a reporter in Houston for the Houston Chronicle. So I was like um, why don't we just do this over the phone?

Sarah Koenig
You didn't tell him?

Ryan Smith
I didn't tell him. I just pretended I was from the Chronicle. I was like hopefully that they don't ask. Because I don't really feel like explaining it. Because I don't even understand it completely.

Sarah Koenig
What Ryan doesn't understand completely is the brave new world of journalism he's entered. Ryan works for a company that pays people in, say, Chicago, Raleigh, or Boise, to create stories for papers in California, Virginia, or Connecticut, which means embedded in major newspapers all over the country are local notes and stories produced by people who might not know how to pronounce the names of the places they're writing about. They call it hyper-local news. The stories are mostly short, just a paragraph or two sometimes-- the Sheriff's report from York [? Pecosine ?] County, Virginia, who died in Poughkeepsie, New York, and who got a marriage license in Pearland, Texas, the names of all the kids on the headmaster's list at Trinity Preparatory School in Winter Park, Florida.

They do bowling scores, and school lunch menus, and real estate transfers, and holiday trash pickup schedules. Nothing is too small. And the engine of this whole endeavor is data, tons of data that the company mines, and sorts, and enters into databases, public information, and also harder to find records. It works like an assembly line. One person does research. Another generates a lead. Another writes it. Sometimes a couple of paragraphs might be written by computer using an algorithm. And someone else edits it.

The goal is to create the largest local news machine ever. In the next few months, they want to quadruple their output to produce 100,000 stories a week. The company behind this vision is called Journatic, or maybe Journatic. Ryan himself isn't sure.

Ryan Smith
I've honestly never actually heard it said. But I've always said Journatic.

Sarah Koenig
Why are you assuming it's Journatic and not Journatic?

Ryan Smith
I mean the way you are saying it, it kind of sounds like heretic. Journatic sounds more like journalism.

Sarah Koenig
It does sound like journalism. But what makes Ryan uneasy is that he's not sure it is journalism. Ryan went to journalism school, has been a reporter for newspapers in Missouri, and California, and Chicago, for a dozen years. He got the Journatic job about a year and a half ago when he saw a tweet about it. He emailed his resume. But he was never interviewed. Eventually he got an email offering him some work.

And in fact in all the time he's worked at Journatic, he's never spoken directly to his supervising editor, who sits in St. Louis. They communicate exclusively through the computer. When Ryan has a question about how to do something, his supervisor sometimes answers by posting a private video on YouTube. That's the only time Ryan's ever heard the guy's voice. It's all very future.

After he got the student of the week assignment, Ryan was put in charge of editing death notices and little business briefs for Newsday, a newspaper on Long Island.

Ryan Smith
And my job was just to copy edit it and again, put it in the database.

Sarah Koenig
And where were these stories coming from? Like who was doing the writing that you were editing?

Ryan Smith
I was told, actually, that they're located in the Philippines.

Sarah Koenig
That everything you were editing was coming from the Philippines?

Ryan Smith
That's what I was told at the time, that these obituaries and these business stories were all written in the Philippines.

Sarah Koenig
I know, right? In the Philippines-- which means when you look up the death notice, say, of a man named Eugene Squeleney Jr. on newsday.com, you see a story about him. But there's no reporters name attached to it. It just says special to Newsday under the headline. But the story was actually written by someone in the Philippines. Journatics internal records listed her as Diana D. and say that Diane got the story from the obituary website legacy.com and just slightly rewrote the information there.

I called Newsday's newsroom to ask about this, why they would use Journatic for this work. I didn't get too far. Mostly I learned that Newsday has exciting hold music. I talked to an editor who didn't want to go on tape. When I pointed out the Squeleney story with no reporter's name on it, just special to Newsday, the editor said, quote, "I am totally unfamiliar with this. I don't know what it is," unquote.

Then I talked to a company spokesman who cheerfully said he'd look into it. But a few days later, I got an email saying he quote, "could not provide any information on this." He wouldn't even say whether Newsday was working with Journatic. Ryan says he learned about the Filipino writers after complaining to his supervisor that the copy he was getting was rife with basic grammar and spelling errors. That's when his editor told him to cut the writer some slack. They weren't native speakers. So Ryan wondered, why do we have these writers at all?

His editor wrote back quote, "well someone has to summarize the obits for the death briefs. And it's cheaper to pay an outsourced writer than to have an American writer editor do it. Unfortunately they're basically paid pennies for these. I have Filipinos asking for better pay on a regular basis. I wish I could do something for them." An ad Journatic placed seeking Filipino writers offered 0.35 to $0.40 per story. I confirmed with a Filipino writer that they are paid 35 to $0.40 a story and more for longer stuff. But wait, there's more. Here's Ryan.

Ryan Smith
When I ended up looking at the names on a lot of the stories-- and the names on the stories that were published weren't the ones that I saw that had written the stories.

Sarah Koenig
Here's what he's talking about. In the Chicago Tribune's local site covering the towns of Homewood and Flossmoor, for example, you can see that Eric and Joan So-and-so have listed for sale their 4 bedroom, 4.5 bath home on such-and-such a street for $695,000, that Eric is a general manager of a building company, that he attended Roosevelt University. And there's a picture of him.

The reporters name on the story is Jenny Cox. But there is no Jenny Cox. Or even if there is a Jenny Cox somewhere out there, she didn't write the story. The writer was someone named Giselle Bautista in the Philippines who works for Journatic. Again, looking at the computer system the company uses to manage its stories, it seems that when Giselle worked on this real estate story, there was a button called Select Alias. When she clicked on it, she had a choice. She could either be Jenny Cox or Glenda Smith.

Journatics real estate stories come from a real estate website it also owns, called BlockShopper. Some other fake names that have made their way onto the news sites of Journatics clients in the real estate sections-- Carrie Reed, Amy Anderson, Jay Brownstown, Christine Scott, Bettie Verdoon, Sam Andrews, Carla Andrews, Deana Andrews, Sienna Andrews, Cindy Valens, Angie Barrett, CJ Marx, John Simon, Shania Samson, Scott Johnson, and my favorite--

Sarah Koenig
Who is Jimmy Finkle?

Ryan Smith
I have no idea. He sounds like a game show host kind of.

Sarah Koenig
I feel like he sounds like a Jewish gangster. You talk to Jimmy Finkle, the Finks. He'll straighten you out. So you don't know who Jimmy Finkle is.

Ryan Smith
I have no idea.

Sarah Koenig
Yet you have edited a story with the byline of Jerry Finkle.

Ryan Smith
Correct.

Sarah Koenig
So who wrote it?

Ryan Smith
Well--

Sarah Koenig
All of this seems wrong to Ryan, which is why he doesn't tell most people where he works. He's embarrassed.

Ryan Smith
It's sort of a tattered product that's being written overseas, and half-heartedly edited, and just kind of slopped on the page. And journalism is supposed to be sort of like a local institution, and written by people that care about what's going on there. When I was a reporter on the Daily Beat, sometimes it was hard. Sometimes you had to agonize over things. And sometimes you had to make tough decisions. And you didn't always get things right, and things like that. And you actually cared about it.

With this, I was writing stories. And I don't know those communities. And I have no stake in them. And so it didn't matter to me that I found out all the information and I got it right. And so there is just something inauthentic about the whole process. And the picking of fake names for these writers in the Philippines is just a symptom of that. The whole thing--

Sarah Koenig
When Ryan agreed to this interview, I didn't realize he was going to be quite so frank.

Sarah Koenig
Oh my god. Ryan, you are so fired.

Ryan Smith
I am.

Sarah Koenig
And are you OK with that?

Ryan Smith
Um, yeah.

Sarah Koenig
When he agreed to do this interview, Ryan figured he'd be fired afterwards. But he says it's worth it if he can do something good for journalism. He says the work he does at Journatic has been weighing on his conscience. But there's another side to this, one that turns everything Ryan thinks about local reporting on its head.

Brian Timpone
I personally think that we're saving journalism with our approach.

Sarah Koenig
This is Brian Timpone, Ryan's boss's boss's boss, the founder and CEO of Journatic. And it is pronounced Journatic, by the way. Timpone says it's a mix of journalism and automatic. When I first spoke to him on the phone, he began talking a mile a minute. First of all, he loved our radio show. I'm not kidding. I'm president of your fan club. And I'm not saying this just so you'll give me favorable treatment. I mean I know you're going to make me look bad. But I don't care. I'll deal with it. Because I believe in what we're doing. We're doing God's work. We're not, like, evil. I used to be a reporter.

Needless to say, I liked him right away. And I wanted to understand how what he was doing would save journalism. Timpone's premise is that what he calls the single reporter model, the old way of doing local reporting, that Ryan used to do and that I used to do as a local reporter-- that it just doesn't work, and that it hasn't really worked in 30 or 40 years.

Brian Timpone
It's going to get better if we do it this way. That's my belief.

Sarah Koenig
What's going to get better?

Brian Timpone
Journalism is going to get better.

Sarah Koenig
How?

Brian Timpone
We need to see more things. No one covers suburban America. No one covers all these small towns. Look at that story in-- was in Dixon, Illinois, that lady stole like 30 million bucks?

Sarah Koenig
It was actually 53 million bucks in the end. The town controller had been siphoning taxpayer money off the budget for 20 years before another city worker filling in for her stumbled on it.

Brian Timpone
How'd that happen? No one was watching. And I'm not saying we're the solution. But we're certainly on the road to the solution. We're going to look at that stuff and help our partners. And there's 400 people or something in the Chicago Tribune newsroom. And they couldn't cover Dixon. They had enough on their plate. There's a darn daily newspaper in that town. I live in River Forest. There's a weekly paper there. And Maywood, next to me-- there's nothing-- literally nothing.

Sarah Koenig
Yeah.

Brian Timpone
Not a single paper covering the town. Isn't that scary? So how is that going to get solved?

Sarah Koenig
The most radical part of Timpone's pitch, at least to me, is that if you're trying to cover a town like say, Flossmoor, south of Chicago, being on the ground is actually a hindrance.

Sarah Koenig
So you're saying it doesn't matter. It just does it matter. You don't need to be there.

Brian Timpone
What I'm saying is go to Flossmoor. We should go together. Let's go walk the streets of Flossmoor together. And tell me what you learn by being there. Let's go live there for six months and tell me if you feel better equipped to cover the budget. You won't be. That's the kind of--

Sarah Koenig
Really?

Brian Timpone
Yes, really.

Sarah Koenig
Really? You really believe that, that after six months of living in Flossmoor, I would have no sense of the community or what was important to the people who live there if I actually talked to human beings who live in Flossmoor?

Brian Timpone
Here's what I'd say is if you looked at the content we produce, in most cases, you wouldn't even notice it's from a reporter who lives somewhere else, who is writing the same story. It's just done more efficiently.

Sarah Koenig
You almost said the word cheaply, didn't you?

Brian Timpone
[INAUDIBLE].

Sarah Koenig
I heard it start to come out. I heard a ch--

Brian Timpone
It is cheaply. But it's not. You got me. Yes.

Sarah Koenig
As for the source of that cheap labor, Timpone said, yeah. They've got 100 freelancers offshore, not just in the Philippines, but in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Republics, Brazil, and Africa. In the US, they've got 200 more, plus 50 US staffers and growing. If you want to see what Journatic can do for a big metro paper, look at the Chicago Tribune. About five years ago, long before they hooked up with Journatic, the Tribune decided to get into the community news business. Brad Moore, vice president of Targeted Media for the Tribune Company, told me that they were looking to bring in money, same as a lot of big metro dailies.

The notion is that if you can capture local advertising dollars, then you're not so dependent on big national accounts which can cripple your finances if they pull out. So under the title TribLocal, the Chicago Tribune launched 90 websites and 22 weekly print editions covering towns all around Chicago. To staff the sites, Tribune hired 18 reporters. But Brad Moore told me that model just didn't work. Reporters weren't generating enough stories to keep people coming to the websites. And hiring a bunch more reporters was too expensive.

So this spring, Tribute higher Journatic. It actually bought a share in the company to run TribLocal. As part of the switch over, the Tribune laid off about half of its 40 person TribLocal staff, including seven reporters. Another 11 reporters were sent to Tribune's larger suburban bureaus. Here's Brad Moore from the Trib.

Brad Moore
So far, we're very happy with what Journatic is doing for us. We're getting a lot more content.

Sarah Koenig
And when you say you're getting more content, how much more content?

Brad Moore
It looks from a sheer volume standpoint, about three times the amount of content pieces that we had before.

Sarah Koenig
And for cheaper, for less money.

Brad Moore
In most cases, yes. And then we're already looking at ways to reinvest those savings into more towns. We've actually launched two additional towns in TribLocal that we weren't in before, Homewood, and Flossmoor, and Oaklawn-- actually three towns. We're looking at the city of Chicago to see what neighborhoods we might want to launch into. So yes, it's more content. It's at a savings. But more excitingly, we hope to take that savings and reinvest it into more coverage.

Sarah Koenig
Brad Moore said the TribLocal local sites are getting more web traffic now the Jounatic has taken over. And Moore says he has no problem with out of state or offshore workers generating news briefs and small stories. But the subject was sensitive enough that he didn't want to discuss on tape who was writing what and under what name. Because no newspaper wants the story about them to be Tribune Fires American Writers, Hires Filipinos for Cheaper. All he would say on tape about it was this--

Brad Moore
Just to be clear, all of the writing and editing of everything that Journatic is doing is happening by professional journalists here in the US.

Sarah Koenig
I went around and around about this with both Brad Moore and Brian Timpone who insisted that Filipinos were not writing stories. They were more like typing information, assembling it in paragraph form, which sounds to me a lot like writing. Brian Timpone told me this was a semantic confusion I was having.

Brian Timpone
Really what they're doing is assembling and copy editing a bunch of facts, right? So they write the lead. If there's a paragraph about a person, the paragraph is technically written by someone in the Philippines, but not written. It's like they have to type out who the person is, right? So they have to know how to write to send it over. I mean but to say oh, it's written in the Philippines-- I mean there might be a paragraph of it that the first draft is written in the Phillipines.

Sarah Koenig
Timpone declined to put me in touch with any of his Filipino employees. But I reached out to half a dozen of them on my own.

Sarah Koenig
You yourself are writing those stories, right? You're not just gathering the information and sending it along to an American writer or editor. You yourself are writing those.

Man
Yeah.

Sarah Koenig
That one word is all you're going to hear from this particular worker at his request. He's got a full time professional job. But he told me his Journatic work pays better. And he needs the money to help pay his family's expenses. Plus he likes the work. Back in April when the Tribune announced that Journatic would be providing stories for TribLocal, some readers and media watchers instantly began to grumble about the job losses but also about the product. It was canned, they said, barely rewritten press releases and daily stories under the news section about top DVD rentals in town or where to find the cheapest gas according to gasbuddy.com. No context, no analysis.

Chicago Media columnist, Robert Feder, wrote, "I used to look forward to receiving TribLocal, the weekly hyperlocal news insert in my Chicago Tribune. But now it's become a worthless piece of garbage. Major news stories in my suburb are completely ignored. In its first three weeks, I've seen nothing in this new rag but press releases, computer generated junk, and of course ads. What passes for a police blotter is a long list of street names, one and two word descriptions, and a time and date," unquote.

Journatic does longer stories too that actually require real reporting. But even there the quality is questionable. Take this story Ryan Smith wrote for TribLocal about the Flossmoor village budget. Flossmoor is one of the towns the Trib started covering when Journatic took over, a small upper middle class town south of Chicago. Ryan had never been to Flossmoor. But he looked at the budget online and called the village's finance director. His lead was at the village board had passed the budget, quote, "which the board says reflects a healthy state of the villages finances."

But Ryan didn't know whether there was any argument over the budget or taxes beforehand. Again he had never covered the town before.

Ryan Smith
I'm sure there was a public meeting. And there may have been people that were upset about the way that they were spending their money. Maybe they were upset that $500,000 is being used to replace the streetlights. But I didn't see those people. I didn't know if there were any objections.

Sarah Koenig
And you weren't going to call around and find out was there any dissent? Was anybody at the meeting?

Ryan Smith
I wasn't told to. I was told to talk to one source and then just get a couple quotes basically, and then just plug it in. I just had to talk to some city official, who is going to want to paint the city in the best light possible. So you don't get the other side with this kind of reporting.

Sarah Koenig
Of course Ryan could've made a few more calls to find out if there had been any controversy. But it wasn't worth his while.

Ryan Smith
Especially for a reporter, for a freelance writer, if you're only getting paid $12 for a story, it's not really in your interest to do a proper reporter's job on it.

Sarah Koenig
Is that what you got paid, $12?

Ryan Smith
For this story, yeah, I believe it's $12 or $14.

Sarah Koenig
Ryan spent three or four hours on the story, which means he was paid something like $4 an hour. At that rate, it makes a lot more sense for you to churn out as many $12 stories as you can as fast as you can, which means you don't call more than one source. And you might miss the meaning of your story. There actually is a suburban paper which covers Flossmoore. It's called the South Town Star. I called its managing editor, Joe Biesk. And he said they sent a freelancer, who lives in Flossmoore, to that budget meeting, which Ryan never attended.

The freelancer told her editor that the budget passed by the village board was a continuation of the one already in place, and there was nothing that stood out to her. So Biesk said, we made an editorial decision not to run a story.

That's the old way. Go to the meeting. Consider the context. And then decide whether it's newsworthy. Journatics' way is just the facts, lots and lots of facts.

Journatics founder, Brian Timpone, understands that his company doesn't do perfect reporting. Stop comparing us to the New York Times, he told me. All we are saying is, if you want to do community news, cover places you've never covered before, Journatic can get you started.

And if Journatic does the busy work, it frees up real staff reporters at papers like the Trib, or the Houston Chronicle, or the Hartford Current, to do more substantial hard hitting work. And it gives these reporters access to all kinds of data they might have had before. All those school board minutes, and village budgets, and city council agendas nobody wants to look at-- Timpone's saying we'll look at them.

Brian Timpone
I would posit that it's better to have somebody look at them than to have nobody look at them. You know what? Newspapers are firing people. Newspapers are struggling. They're going bankrupt. We have a solution that helps solve the problem, right? Cutting staff is not the way to growth. But empowering a reporter with people in the Philippines-- that's a really smart thing to do. The criticism's fine. But at the end of the day, what's a better solution?

Sarah Koenig
Yeah.

Brian Timpone
I mean do you have one? Tell me if you have a better idea, I'm all ears.

Sarah Koenig
I don't have a better idea. And the newspaper business as a whole doesn't seem to have a better idea, not unless consumers want to start paying properly for their news. So many newspapers are floundering and bleeding staff. According to the website Paper Cuts, something like 35,000 people have lost newspaper jobs since 2008 because of layoffs and buyouts. Unlike most newspapers in America, Journatic is hiring.

Ira Glass
Sarah Keonig. She's one of the producers of our program. After she asked Brian Timpone about the fake names on certain stories that Journatic publishes, Timpone told her that Journatic decided to eliminate the fake names. Brad Moore of the Chicago Tribune told us that the Trib is not going to allow them any more either. The stories that Filipino writers work on will be credited to the editors of the stories. We will get a generic byline like Neighborhood News Service. The real Filipinos' names will not appear in the paper.

Coming up, learning to eat fish eyes and suck marrow from chicken bones to get close to mom. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International when our program continues.

It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, Switcharoo, people pretending to be something they are not, sometimes harmlessly, sometimes not so harmlessly, sometimes it's hard to tell which one it is.

Act Three. Runaway Groom.

Ira Glass
We've arrived at Act Three of our program. Act Three, Runaway Groom. We close our show today with parents who are pretending to be parents, though as you'll hear sometimes not pretending very hard. Jackie Clarke tells what happened.

Jackie Clarke
The life rules my father would announce to my brother, my sister, and me, were never rules that any other parents seemed to have, like when I was five and he told me, a real woman doesn't drink beer, especially from a can. Or you ever notice that only ugly people end up on welfare? Or the time he was teaching me to use a handgun in our backyard in suburban Massachusetts. Always shoot to kill, Jackie, never to wound. Shoot to kill. I was 10.

My mom-- I don't remember a lot about. She died when I was in first grade-- complications from diabetes. And for a couple of years after my mom died, my dad did his best to raise us on his own. He made a point of having family dinners. He coached our soccer teams, threw us birthday parties. Eventually he started dating. For a while he was a member of a support group called Parents Without Partners. But he quit because he said it was all chunky broads looking for a husband. That's when the catalogs started arriving.

My dad had decided he wanted a mail order bride. He never hid it from his kids. Over plates of spaghetti he'd passed out the latest mail order bride catalog and tell us to pick out the ones you like. My sister and I always picked out the pretty ones with nice smiles. I don't think we really understand what we were looking at. It seemed like a Sears wish book for moms.

Then one day this Filipino beauty arrived. Her name was Pura. She was 25 years old. And she married my father in a Justice of the Peace ceremony. And instead of taking his new bride on a honeymoon, my dad took off for one of his month long business trips overseas. And we three kids were left in the care of a woman he had found in a catalog.

My siblings and I dealt with Pura in different ways. My sister, Allie, made trouble. My brother, Jeff, became invisible. But I was the middle child. And I wanted things to work. I was 100% on board for Pura as our new mother. I asked Pura if I could call her mom. She said call me Pura. I tried to be exactly like her. When Pura ate fish eyes and sucked the marrow out of chicken bones, so did I. Pura told me that when she was a girl, she'd slept with a close pin on her nose to make it look more American. So I started pressing my nose flat to my face to make it look more Filipino.

In fifth grade when my teacher went around the room asking us what nationality we where, I told her Filipino. She looked at my pale freckled skin and blue eyes and asked again. Really? I nodded. Yep, I'm Filipino. Through my whole teenage years, I continued to expect Pura to suddenly start acting like the moms in the Judy Blume books I loved. When I was 12, I asked Pura if she could show me how to shave my legs. I had it in my mind she would jump at the chance. And we would giggle and bond. She wasn't interested.

When I got my first period, I didn't know what had happened, not because I wasn't expecting it, but because it wasn't red like blood-- more brownish. So I just put my soiled underpants in the laundry hamper. A week later, a giant box of generic sanitary pads appeared on my bed. I asked Pura why they were there. She looked down at me and said, you got your period, stupid.

It wasn't that Pura didn't like me. She just had no desire to be a mother to me. And all this made be closer to my dad. He was gone a lot for work, sometimes months at a time. But when he was around, he had this way of swooping in at key moments. He was the one who helped me shave my legs when Pura refused to do it, using his BIC razor and his Edge shaving gel. He was also the one who took me shopping for my first bra.

And I was there for him. You see, his marriage to Pura was never a good one. It was basically hellish fighting followed by silent treatments. And I was my dad's apologist. Whenever Pura or my siblings got mad at my dad, I defended him. I backed him up. So it's not surprising to me that I was the one my dad came to years later when he needed to confess to someone in our family and that he actually had a second family.

I was in college when my dad told me that after only a few years of marriage to Pura and unbeknownst to us all, he had started a new relationship with another Filipino woman. This one lived in the Philippines. Her name was Joedin and they had two children together. I was home on break for Thanksgiving when he broke the news to me, that basically he had been lying to our whole family for years, that his prolonged business trips weren't just for business. They were trips so he could visit and take care of his other family. But I didn't freak out. I wanted to be there for my dad. I knew that, yes, what my father was doing was terrible, and bizarre, and wrong. But somehow my next thought was maybe has a good reason.

Finally, after 16 years of marriage, Pura sued my father for divorce. And as a lot of you may know, divorce is hard on everybody. Raise your hand out there if your parents are divorced and they expected you to take sides. That's the worst, right? OK. Now raise your hand if your stepmother snuck into your fathers house and snatched a bunch of documents, and possibly again, and then got so mad she stabbed the couch to death with a kitchen knife.

In a divorce case lasting five years, my father appeared in court a total of 0 times. As the case progressed, the following things about my father became clear. We discovered he had moved almost all of his money to an offshore bank account in the Bahamas. We discovered he had applied for several credit cards in the name of our parrot, Ranya Clark, and then maxed them out. And we discovered that the only checking account he had access to in the United States was in the name of this Thai man my father used to do business with named [? Peishit ?] [? Asflopluprong ?].

I know it sounds like I'm making up that name, but it's a real name. And the final and most upsetting discovery was when my father informed me he had moved to the Philippines and was going to stay there with no intentions of ever settling his divorce with Pura.

So Pura had no other recourse. She sued me and my brother and sister for $200,000. Actually, technically, we had to sue her. You see the judge was going to award Pura the house we all grew up in since my dad was doing nothing to intervene. But this was the house that my mom had left us when she died. it was also the house that my sister and her son, Troy, were currently living in.

So the three of us fought Pura in court. During the trial the judge made a statement from the bench. She said she admired us kids for sticking together. Then she said my father was not a good man, which was the first time I had heard someone who wasn't married to my father accuse him of that. In the end, we offered Pura a cash settlement. And she accepted. We mortgaged the hell out of the house to get Pura the money. We kids paid for our fathers divorce, $200,000.

The last time I spoke to my dad was about a month after the trial ended. I was in a cab in New York City, late for an appointment. And my father called me from the Philippines. I told them that we lost the court case. And before I could stop myself, I asked him what he thought we should do as if he was going to fix it. I still thought he would do the right thing, that he would be a dad. But he didn't do the right thing. He didn't swoop in and help. He just avoided the question. Then he told me not to give anyone his cell phone number, especially Pura.

I hung up the phone and burst into tears. And yes, I know it's crazy that I hadn't already written my dad off by this point. I just didn't get it. I knew that Pura was never the mom I so badly wanted. But I just couldn't see that my dad was never really the dad I thought he was. I always thought that of the two of them, he was my one real parent. I was wrong. That was almost the worst part, that I had been in such denial about my dad for so long. What the judge said during our trial was right. My father was not a good man.

That phone call was seven years ago. I haven't talked to my father since. And that's not a decision I consciously made. I never said I'm never speaking to my father again. It just happened. Then a couple of months ago, I was at work when my sister told me that my father came up as a suggestion on Facebook as one of her people you may know. I asked her to send me the link.

I went into my office and pulled up his page. It was so weird seeing him. So much time had passed. He had stopped being a person to me. He had just become an idea, a story I would tell. But there he was on my computer screen, standing on a mountain with his arm around Joedin, his second Filipino bride-- smiling, older, heavier. He was real. And I thought that man-- he's my father.

Ira Glass
Jackie Clarke. She's a comedian who currently writes for the ABC sitcom, Happy Endings. Her Twitter handle is JackieClarke. It may not come as a surprise that some facts in this story are in dispute. Pura declined to comment about whether she took some documents and maybe a gun from her husband and-or stabbed a couch. Jackie's dad, who we reached by email, suggested that Jackie is an embellisher and quote, "a rather vulgar comedian." Her dad wrote that he did not have offshore bank accounts, though court documents indicate that, in fact, he did. Jackie's dad said he did have a checking account under the name [? Peishit ?] [? Asflopluprong?], but quote, "under agreement and request by a Thai Chinese associate," end quote.

He wrote that he did not apply for credit cards in the family parrot's name, though he did confirm that it's name is Rayna. Rayna is still alive. Asked if he is now or has ever been on Facebook, he replied, quote, "I do not engage in social advertising sites," end quote. Jackie's sister and brother told us that they have the same memories of her father doing these things that Jackie does.

Brian Timpone
If there's a paragraph about a person, the paragraph is technically written by someone in the Philippines, but not written. It's like they have to type it. They have to type out who the person is, right? So they have to know how to write.

Ira Glass
I'm Ira Glass, back next week with more stories of This American Life.

Announcer
PRI, Public Radio International.

IRA GLASS 
Julia's 13. Jane and Ella are 14. And when they came to our studio for an interview, they did this thing they do all the time when they hang out. They take pictures of themselves. And-- no surprise-- they post them to Instagram.

Ira Glass
There you go.

Jane
No, retake it. It's really bad.

Ella
Jane, calm down.

Julia
It doesn't matter, OK? This is what happens every time.

Ella
I'm just gonna post it and we'll see--

Jane
We'll see what happens.

Ella
--how quickly everything comes in.

Ira Glass
So what's your prediction on what's going to happen?

Ella
Usually there's at least-- usually there's two likes in a minute. But I don't know, because people might not be up yet.

Jane
People aren't-- there's--

Ira Glass
It was 11:00 in the morning on a day with no school, not prime time for posting photos at all. Nighttime is usually when you get the most likes and comments. But, you know, 11:00 AM. A minute passes. No response on the photo they took in the studio. And then?

Ella
Oh, wait, three likes.

Julia
Oh, three likes.

Jane
From Ro--

Ella
From three people. No one's commented yet. One of these is my best friend. OK, another person liked it. Two people.

Jane
Two people. OK, we're getting a lot of likes now.

Ella
Three. Another person.

Jane
How many likes do we have now?

Ella
Six, I think.

Jane
OK, we have one, two, three, four, five, six likes in a minute. That's actually good, Ella.

Ira Glass
What they're waiting for is not just likes and comments but a specific kind of comment. This is probably not going to be news to any of you who have teenage girls in your lives, but I bet lots of you do not know about this. They want comments from other girls, and they say the wording is pretty much always the same.

Jane
Gorgeous. Pretty. Stunning.

Ella
Stunning? Yeah.

Jane
You kill it. You're so pretty. So beautiful.

Ira Glass
OK, just to be clear, they say this about everybody's selfies, whether or not the selfies are, in fact, stunning or beautiful. This is super-affirming language that is applied equally to every girl, universally. You've heard of bullying online? This is the opposite.

Ella
A lot of people don't just say pretty. You either say like, Pretty, WTF? Gorgeous, WTF? Perfect.

Julia
Like all caps sometimes.

Ella
Um, some people say, like, model. You can add OMG after anything.

Jane
Cutest, like--

Julia
Yeah.

Ella
Something "-est."

Ira Glass
The one word you don't say? "Sexy." They explained you could say "hot," but never "sexy."

Jane
They are-- there's a different--

Ella
They're the same thing, actually.

Jane
There's a different connotation to "sexy" than there is to "hot."

Ella
'Cause, like, it has the word "sex" in it. Sex.

Julia
Yeah, I think it's the word.

Ella
Like, intercourse.

Jane
Ella!

[GIRLS GIGGLE]

Ira Glass
This is not about sex. It's not about boys. It's about girls, and friendship. And it's very repetitive-- the same phrases, over and over. I asked them each to pick a selfie that they'd posted and read the comments.

Jane
So I have gorgeous, pretty.

Ella
You're so pretty, OMG.

Jane
So pretty.

Ella
This is so pretty, OMG.

Jane
Heart eyes. So pretty. Heart eyes. Gorgeous. Gorge.

Ella
You're so pretty, bye.

Jane
Cutest.

Ira Glass
They say their parents don't understand this. Ella's mom has Instagram, so she sees the pictures and the comments.

Ella
She's just like, why? Why? Why is everyone doing this? Like, why are 50 people feeling the need to tell you that you're pretty?

Ira Glass
Julia's mom? Same thing.

Julia
She's like, why? Why are all these people saying, like, oh, you're so perfect? And my dad just thinks it's funny. He's like, why are these people doing this? Like, it doesn't-- it's kind of stupid. They think it's, like, stupid.

Ira Glass
So what's it about? Well, the answer to that question is complicated, and it involves going deep into an intricate language that's going on in the comments. Welcome to WBEZ Chicago. It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass.

Today's program is about status updates of various kinds-- the literal kind, like on Instagram. But most of our show today is about the kind of slow changes in status that happen to adults, that happen usually when people get money or they get recognition, where what happens is, you know, quiet, and slow, and really, is sometimes kind of rude to talk about. Like, when do you say to anybody, "Hey, you're making a lot more money than you used to." Or, "Hey, you're making a lot less money." Or, "You're making a lot more money than me."

And that's why I wanted to talk to Jane and Ella and Julia. Because for them, this stuff is not gradual or vague or shameful to talk about. It's happening out in the open, online. They're online all the time, constantly getting updates on the social standing of everybody they know, in detail and at incredible speed. And that's what these Instagram comments are all about, if you know how to read them.

Act One. Finding the Self in Selfie.

Ella
It's definitely a social obligation, because you want to let them know, and also let people who are seeing those, that I have a close relationship with this person, so close that I can comment on their pictures, like, this is so cute, or, you look so great here.

Ira Glass
Then, of course, when you do post a comment about a picture, there's the whole politics of whether your friend is going to comment back to your comment. And subtle differences in the wording when they comment back could mean something, even though, to an outsider, the words basically look the same. Julia says that she'll comment back, oh my god, I love you so much, to a close friend who compliments a picture of hers. But she says with somebody you don't know so well, it goes differently.

Julia
If they say, like, oh my god, like, you're so pretty, you say, OMG, but that's you. You know, like-- like you're the pretty one? I feel like that's something that I say to someone who's like-- who I'm not super close with, but I feel like-- like I have to say something back.

Jane
Especially because we, like, just started high school, so we're meeting a lot of new people. So you would comment on someone's photo who you're not really super close with or that you don't know really well. And it's sort of a statement, like, I want to be friends with you, or I want to get to know you, or like, I think you're cool.

If someone that you don't know very well commented on your photo, you-- it's sort of like an unspoken agreement that you have to comment back on their photo. Like when you're making new friends, if they comment on your photo, you comment on their photo.

Ella
It's like a chain reaction.

Ira Glass
Another thing you don't see if you don't know this language of comments and commenting back-- let's say that you comment on somebody's photo. When they comment back, do they comment to you individually? Or do they group you in with 20 or 30 other people and send just one big group comment back to all of you? That tells you where you stand with the person.

Then there are all those situations where somebody choosing not to comment is a really big deal. Like for example, if you post a picture of yourself with a friend and then the friend does not comment on that picture, that's just cold. That is leaving you dangling. Or if you post a selfie, close friends are expected to chime in with support. When they don't?

Ella
You definitely feel insecure. Because, like, you expect them to comment, and they don't, and you're like, why?

Julia
This isn't even good enough for, like, my best friend.

Ella
Yeah.

Julia
Then you're like, oh, wait.

Jane
Like, what if they've seen it and they're just not liking it on purpose, or like, what if everybody who's seeing it thinks that we're not actually friends because they're not commenting on it. They haven't commented yet. It's been X amount of time and they still haven't liked it.

Julia
It's this kind of shallow-- like, why are you not responding to something that I never said you had to respond to in the first place?

[LAUGHTER]

Ira Glass
And tell me about how quickly people have to respond. Like, what's the normal amount of time?

Ella
Within 10 minutes, I think.

Jane
Yeah, usually.

Julia
People are always on Instagram. Everyone's always on Instagram.

Jane
There's definitely a weird psychology to it.

Julia
Yeah.

Ella
Definitely.

Jane
It's just sort of the way it is. It's like unspoken rules that everybody knows and follows.

Ira Glass
But can I ask you, have you gotten caught up in weird mind games where somebody commented or liked or didn't comment or didn't like, and then you're just like, I don't-- what does this-- what does this one means?

Ella
Yeah. Someone like--

Julia
Ella has an example. I mean, these girls that went to our middle school, they--

Ella
Yeah, this is not my picture, but someone said, what even? You're perfect. I hate you. Eff you. You suck. And then like someone else, like-- WTF? You're perfect. I hate you.

Jane
Because people-- what they're trying to say is, like, you're still perfect and you're so beautiful that I, like, hate you for it, and I wish I was like you so much that I dislike you for it.

Ella
And how do you respond to that? Like, I'm sorry?

Jane
Because you don't say, like-- you don't say, like, thank you, because it's not really a compliment. You don't really know.

Julia
We've all gotten those comments of-- last year, like, this girl even said it to my face. She was like, you're so pretty, like, I'm going to throw you into the train tracks. Like things that-- like it doesn't even make sense. Like it's--

Jane
Like on my photo right now-- I'm looking at it-- this girl commented, I hate you.

Julia
Um, I've also, like, been, like, caught in the situation where someone's like, you're so pretty, and I'm like, oh, thank you. You're really pretty too. And then we've gotten into this whole thing, and I remember, like magical mirrors came up, like potions.

And I was just like, wait, this is way too deep. Like, you must be looking in a mirror then, because you must be talking to yourself, because you're so pretty. She was like, we should switch bodies with, like, a potion. I was like, what?

Ira Glass
Ella and Julia and Jane say that usually, they'll get 130 to 150 likes for any selfie they put up, and anywhere between 30 and 50 comments, which is a good response. And overwhelmingly, these comments are these super-positive, you're so pretty, OMG, you're so cute kind. And a lot of it is heartfelt, girls just trying to be good friends to each other. When you see your friend put herself out there, it's nice to tell her she's pretty.

Ira Glass
Can I ask, like, does it work? Because you know, when you're getting over 100 likes and comments and things like that, like, you know, a lot of it is just rote, right? A lot of people are just like, they see a thing, and they just automatically--

Jane
Yeah, you're scrolling through.

Ella
It's mindless.

Jane
That's how--

Ira Glass
It's mindless. And so since it's mindless, does it still work? Does it make you feel good?

Jane
Yes.

Julia
Um, actually, if I get a comment from someone I care about, I think it makes me feel good, like it lifts me up.

Jane
A lot of it is just scrolling, too.

Julia
But a lot of it's just, like, I literally just scroll through my Instagram feed and I just, like, click, like double-tap.

Jane
Yeah.

Julia
And like, it doesn't--

Jane
I like everything on my feed.

Julia
You know, like it just doesn't-- and that's what people are doing to your photo. But, like, it still makes you feel good, because you're getting all these likes.

Ira Glass
Yeah, but when you think about it, it's so strange. Because you know how superficial it is.

Julia
It is.

Ira Glass
And yet--

Julia
You know, but yeah.

Ella
Yeah. You know that you're doing it to other people, but--

Ira Glass
And yet it's still--

Ella
Then other people are doing it to you.

Ira Glass
And it still feels like something, though.

Ella
Like, it does make you feel good. You're like, oh, I'm getting all these comments. Like, people like my photo. They think I'm pretty. Like, they're saying that you're pretty. And if someone comes up to you and says you're pretty, like, you're obviously going to be like, thank you, if it makes you feel good. Because it just does. Like, that's like human nature. Like, you're going to feel good.

Ira Glass
This is really not so different from anybody's life on social media. When I tweet something and a friend favorites it, and another friend retweets with a funny comment, that is totally them saying to me, you're so pretty-- just in a more adult kind of way. And it feels nice.

All three of these girls told me they don't need 50 people telling them that they're pretty all the time. But you know, it's there for the taking. It's like free candy. Why not?

Ira Glass
Do you feel like this is a situation where, like, girls are so judged all the time on how they look, and this is a way to counteract that, by you guys saying to each other, like, you're pretty, you're pretty?

Ella
Well, no. It just gives more opportunities for people to judge. They're not going to--

Julia
Yeah, posting a photo of yourself is putting yourself out there.

Ella
They're not going to do it on social media, obviously, because you will see it. But they'll do it behind your back.

Ira Glass
When a girl posts an unflattering selfie, or just a selfie that makes her look uncool, other girls will take screenshots to save the image and gossip about it later. Happens all the time. And so even though they're old hands at posting selfies-- they've been posting since sixth grade-- it can be nervous-making to post one. So they take precautions.

Ella
We all ask people before we post it, like send in like a group chat, or like, send to your friends, like, should I post this? Do I look pretty? And they say, like, all the same stuff that they would say in a comment. Like, oh my god, yes, post it. Like, you're so pretty. You're so perfect. So like--

Ira Glass
And so it'd be like you run it by like four or five friends.

Jane
Yeah. If I send it to my friends, I'm not nervous about it, because then I have--

Julia
OK.

Ira Glass
Jane looks at her phone. There's a message.

Julia
Like someone just texted in a giant group chat, go like my photo on Instagram. It just shows that it happens every--

Ella
It happens every second.

Julia
It happens all the time.

Ella
Yep. I got it, too.

Julia
Yeah.

Ira Glass
I have to say, like, oh my god, this is such a job.

Girls
Yeah.

Julia
It's like I'm-- I'm a brand, and I am like--

Ella
You're trying to promote yourself.

Julia
The brand. I'm the director of the--

Ira Glass
And you're the product.

Jane
You're definitely trying to promote yourself.

Julia
To stay relevant, you have to--

Jane
You have to work hard.

Ella
Relevance is a big term right now.

Ira Glass
Are you guys relevant?

Ella
Um, I'm so relevant.

Jane
In middle school. In middle school, we were definitely really relevant.

Ella
(SARCASTICALLY) We were so relevant.

Jane
Because everything was established. But now, in the beginning of high school, you can't really tell who's relevant.

Ira Glass
Yeah. And what does relevant mean?

Jane
Relevant means that people care about what you're posting on Instagram. People--

Julia
Care about you.

Jane
--want to know what you're doing. People will open your Snapchat stories.

Ira Glass
They're only three months into high school, so there is a lot at stake right now.

Julia
One of my, like, best friends posts a selfie. Maybe this isn't, like, healthy. But I might go through the comments and see who she's, like, really good friends with, just 'cause we're in high school and there's that sense of jealousy between everyone.

Ira Glass
Do you have people who you're jealous of?

Jane
Yeah.

Julia
Yeah. I definitely would. I go through, like, the comments that people see-- like that people say, and like, I see what other people have said to other people.

Jane
Yeah.

Julia
Just to see, like, the whole-- like, the whole social like map.

Jane
Looking, mapping out your social world, seeing who's with who, who's hanging out with who, who is best friends with who.

Julia
If you didn't have it, like, I feel like I'd be missing so much. And it would just--

Jane
Because you wouldn't see what other people were saying. A lot goes on.

Ira Glass
Well, no, that's, I feel like, the thing that I'm understanding from this conversation, is like-- it's actually like, you're getting a picture of your entire social world and who's up and who's down and who's close to who, and it's like you're getting a diagram of where everybody stands with everybody else.

Jane
Yeah.

Ella
Yeah.

Jane
Definitely. Definitely.

Ira Glass
As it changes in real time, every day, every 10 minutes.

Ella
Yeah.

Jane
Yeah. Everyone can see it.

Julia
It's crazy.

Ella
You see these comments. You screenshot them. You show them to your friends at school.

Jane
Yeah, I will screenshot things, and be like, look what she said, look what she said. Like even if it's funny.

Julia
I didn't know that these people were close. When did this happen?

Ira Glass
This is the main thing they get from Instagram, they say. After all, each of them only post a couple pictures a week. Not that much of their time on Instagram is being told they're pretty. Most of it is this, dissecting and calibrating the minutiae of the social diagram.

[MUSIC - "YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL" BY JUSSIE SMOLLETT &amp; YAZZ]

Act Two. Mon Ami Ta-Nehisi.

Ira Glass
Act 2. Mon Ami Ta-Nehisi. Well, our show today is about status updates. And you know, it's weird when a sudden change of status happens to somebody who you're close with. And that's true whether their status goes up or their status goes down.

One of our producers, Neil Drumming, is best friends with the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, who I think a lot of people heard of for the first time a couple years ago when he wrote this article arguing the case for reparations for black Americans. That article was nothing compared to the attention that Ta-Nehisi got when his latest book was published this summer. The book has been on the New York Times Bestseller List ever since. He's been interviewed all over the place. He's been called the next James Baldwin. Ta-Nehisi Coates was suddenly famous and rich, and Neil, our co-worker, definitely was not. He does fine, but, you know. Anyway, it got Neil thinking.

Quick warning-- there's some cursing in this story that we bleeped on the radio version of our show. Here on the podcast and the internet, we are unbleeping it. If you're somebody who prefers the bleeped version-- maybe you listen to the show with kids-- you can find it at our website.

Neil Drumming
One of the weird things about having a famous friend is that even when he's too busy to hang out, he's sort of around all the time. I hadn't seen Ta-Nehisi in a few months. But in the last year or two, it seemed like everyone was reading his work and talking about it-- everyone on the subway, the President of the United States, my ex who texted me out of the blue to see if I could get her into one of his speaking engagements-- everyone.

But by July, I was cat-sitting just 15 blocks from Ta-Nehisi's apartment and he and I still hadn't connected. We tried, but it just didn't work out. I was walking past a newsstand on Broadway, thinking I should try texting him again, that I had so much to tell him. And when I looked up, he was right in front of me, his big-ass disembodied head staring at me from the cover of New York Magazine.

By the end of the summer, Ta-Nehisi had turned 40 and moved his family to Paris. He won the MacArthur Genius Award. He was across the ocean, and coworkers were congratulating me for him. It's wild having the world talk so much about someone you know and with whom you share so much history. It's exciting and, oddly, kind of gratifying. I'm happy for him.

The thing I'm having trouble with is harder to explain. I know Ta-Nehisi's the same guy-- warm, funny, curious, loves comic books. But he's also a famous writer who lives in Paris, accepts prestigious awards in a tuxedo that he owns, and gets shout-outs from Toni Morrison and Jay Z. He's changing in ways that I'm not. And when people change, they grow apart. And it makes me worry about our friendship.

Like when we're making plans. A couple of months ago, Ta-Nehisi, our other buddy, Rick, and I were supposed to meet for Sunday brunch at our old West Side haunt, The Half King. The Half King is a pub, not a dive, a respectable pub with good service, good beer, and decent food. The morning of the scheduled meeting, he texted to ask if we can meet at the swanky Hotel Marlton instead. His explanation? "I'm becoming that dude."

Rick was understanding. He joked that since eating in Paris, everything back home must taste like dog food. Ta-Nehisi's response? "It's close."

Sometimes he ends emails with unnecessary French interpolations of everyday phrases. In this country, we have a word for such behavior, and it's the same word in Ta-Nehisi's newly adopted language.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Je suis snob.

Neil Drumming
That's how you say, "I'm a snob" in French?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Je suis snob. Snob. I gotta get my accent right. Je suis snob.

Neil Drumming
I tease him about becoming a snob, but we've never really talked about it. And so, cautiously and nervously, a couple weeks ago, I asked him if we could. We texted back and forth to set a time when we could sit down. At one point, he suggested that I go through his assistant.

Ta-Nehisi was tired from a long day of meetings and signing books, so he and I ended up at the bar of the hotel where he was staying. It's a lavish joint with a rooftop pool deck and big, cushioned banquettes in the lounge. We sat up on the mezzanine, overlooking the low-lit bar.

Neil Drumming
Is this the best hotel you ever stayed in?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
No.

Neil Drumming
[LAUGHTER]

Ta-Nehisi Coates
This ain't that good of a hotel. But it's perfectly decent. I got a nice room here.

Neil Drumming
Yeah.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
How's this feel to you? Does this feel like a nice hotel to you?

Neil Drumming
Ta-Nehisi knew we were here to talk about his snobbery, and he wasted zero time getting into character. He told me a story about the other night when he'd had dinner in the restaurant of this very hotel.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
And I was sitting at the bar. And the food was OK. It's like one of these OK food restaurants. But it was decent. I was having a good time. And there was a couple like down the bar, and they had ordered this big-ass thing of oysters. It might have been 24 oysters. It was huge.

Neil Drumming
Ta-Nehisi was fine with that. He loves oysters. It was what happened next that offended him.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Then the bartender started making drinks, right? And he makes the woman a sangria and the other dude some sweet something, some red, sweet something-or-other that no one should ever drink. And he took it over there, and I was like, you're going to drink sangria and eat oysters? Like, we're doing this now? Like, this is a thing you're going to do? Oh, come on.

Neil Drumming
[LAUGHTER]

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Come on. Just order a Hi-C. Get the Capri Sun. Just get the Capri Sun with your oysters.

Neil Drumming
See, this is what I'm talking about.

I met Ta-Nehisi in the late '90s when we were both working at an alternative weekly newspaper in DC. He was still a student at Howard. I had recently graduated from college.

I'm pretty sure neither of us had ever even tasted an oyster back then. Instead, we bonded over hip hop, two-for-one happy hours, the enduring craziness of white people, and wanting to be better writers than the ones in our favorite rap magazine. We bopped around U Street drinking rail liquor and debating the merits of Ghostface, Buckshot, and Brother J.

We did growing-up stuff, too. We paid rent. We met girls. I remember the day Ta-Nehisi came by the cubicle where I worked to tell me his girlfriend was pregnant. I thought, at 24, his life is over. But soon, I'd have a godson.

We also got pretty serious about writing. Eventually, we both ended up in New York. We got jobs. We got married. Our wives became best friends, as well. We stayed close.

During all those years, I honestly don't recall fine dining being a big part of our lives, so it's kind of bizarre to hear Ta-Nehisi go on about it now. The guy talks about food with almost as much passion and conviction as he writes scathing critiques of American institutionalized racism.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
There's this joint in Chicago called the Girl &amp; the Goat, and they made this asparagus last time I was there, and I think about it. Like I actually think about the vegetables.

Neil Drumming
[LAUGHS]

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean, what is this? [LAUGHS] Like sex or something. Like, I think about it. Like god, that was awesome. That was great.

Neil Drumming
I can't imagine feeling so strongly about vegetables. But we're laughing and drinking adult beverages. This is fun and kind of familiar.

Neil Drumming
You know what this makes me think of?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
What?

Neil Drumming
The New Year's Eve parties at the place you used to live in--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah, yeah, yeah, in Brooklyn.

Neil Drumming
In Brooklyn, yeah. Was it Flatbush?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah.

Neil Drumming
Yeah, yeah.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Lefferts Garden.

Neil Drumming
Lefferts Garden, which is a completely different place now.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah.

Neil Drumming
But I remember, we used to have those-- remember we'd have those wine parties, and you had to bring a bottle of wine.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah, I didn't like that.

Neil Drumming
You remember this? You didn't like that? Why? Why didn't you like that?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
That felt status-y to me.

Neil Drumming
Really?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean, what are we doing? We're tasting wine and doing-- I mean, what is this?

Neil Drumming
But remember, it was like you could bring-- everybody brought kind of cheap wine. People were just--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean, [INAUDIBLE] now we're getting to why one wouldn't like it. So we're, like, swapping cheap wine?

Neil Drumming
[LAUGHS]

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Like, what are we doing? Are we just-- I think like my read on that was, are we doing this just to say we're the kind of Negroes that eat cheese and drink wine? There was a point where we didn't go, like, really nice places, right?

Neil Drumming
Yeah, of course not. I mean, remember--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
We used to go to like Lucky Burger.

Neil Drumming
Yeah. And we just--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Isn't it call Lucky's? Isn't that who it's called?

Neil Drumming
Yeah, the joint on the--

Ira Glass
Like 50-something? It's like Hell's Kitchen.

Neil Drumming
Yeah, we used to go there a lot. We used to get burgers. I mean, what's-- OK, listen. I've known you, what, 19 years? 20 years?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Long time.

Neil Drumming
The majority of that time, we ate wings and burgers.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Right.

Neil Drumming
Pretty much the majority of that time.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
And I did eat that stuff then, and I was fine.

Neil Drumming
Yeah, all the time.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
So what happened?

Neil Drumming
This is the reason that you're sitting here, as I'm asking you. OK, well, this is the question.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Well, I made more money, right?

Neil Drumming
Yes.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
That's all it is.

Neil Drumming
I mean, but-- I mean, how much would you attribute it to that?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
A lot.

Neil Drumming
Yeah? Was that ever uncomfortable for you?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
The money's uncomfortable.

Neil Drumming
Yeah.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
The money's uncomfortable. Um-- why is the money uncomfortable? Because you have the money, but like, in your mind, you haven't changed. Like you still rock a hoodie.

Neil Drumming
Yeah, yeah.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
The food is not uncomfortable. The food feels like some bringing to fruition of something that was always there.

Neil Drumming
Mm.

Maybe it is bringing to fruition something that was already there. Ta-Nehisi was always a little picky about what kind of beer he drank. And he'd get anxious whenever his hair got a little bushy, even back in the broke DC days when a regular haircut was an extravagance. I started to wonder if maybe there had been snobbiness under the surface all along and I just missed it.

Still, those are small things, right? He appreciates a nice meal and a trim. So what?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Well, I go to a really nice gym.

Neil Drumming
OK. You would go, or you do?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I do.

Neil Drumming
You do.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I go to a really nice gym.

Neil Drumming
How nice is your gym? What gym could be that nice?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I don't want to name the gym. But I can tell you about the gym.

Neil Drumming
Is it not, like, a consumer gym?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
It is, but it's like really nice.

Neil Drumming
[LAUGHS]

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean when I'm in America. Which--

Neil Drumming
OK.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean, that was the ultimate snob statement right there. I go to a nice gym in Paris, too.

Neil Drumming
But they're different gyms, obviously.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah, different gyms.

Neil Drumming
They're not the same brand.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
No, no, no. But it's just, like, very nice.

Neil Drumming
OK.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I have personal training.

Neil Drumming
[LAUGHTS

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Which is snobbery.

Neil Drumming
Yeah, I can sort of see that.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean, which is-- you know, I mean, I can defend it for you, but it is. It is. It's like privileged to be able to pay for that, right? Like that's some amount of something, you know? I started getting my hair cut every week, too.

Neil Drumming
Well, that was something you always wanted, though.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Oh, I did always want that.

Neil Drumming
You used to talk about that a lot.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah, I always wanted that.

Neil Drumming
You used--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
But is that a kind of snobbery?

Neil Drumming
I don't know.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I think I'm a snob, but I don't think I'm bougie.

Neil Drumming
OK. That's like-- I feel like for This American Life, you're going to have to explain that.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
OK, what bougie means?

Neil Drumming
Yeah. You're gonna have to--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
So "bougie" is a term that black people use-- and I guess white people have used it now, 'cause I see white people using it-- which I think people think is interchangeable with "snob." But I actually don't think.

Neil Drumming
OK.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
OK. So like [INAUDIBLE] say, you know, a bougie's a person who's snob, looks down. But see, bougie people want to be part of a crowd.

Neil Drumming
OK.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Like, they want to be part of the right crowd. So for instance, I don't want to put my son in some exclusive club or something, literally like some sort of societal something or other. Do you know what I mean?

Neil Drumming
So bougie is a status thing. It's about--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah, I don't care about any of that. I actually don't care about my status.

Neil Drumming
OK. All right, all right.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah, I don't go to a nice gym so that I can then tell you I go to a nice gym. I don't have any concern about being seen with the right people. You know what I'm saying? Like, I don't have that. I don't need to be at the right parties.

Neil Drumming
OK.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Like, I don't need any of that.

Neil Drumming
OK.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
And I don't really look down on people who aren't, like, around the right people. Like, I don't have that. That's bougie.

Neil Drumming
OK.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Snobbery, to me, is about, like, things. [LAUGHS] And not about people at all. In fact, it's much worse than bougie. 'Cause it's--

Neil Drumming
Maybe Ta-Nehisi doesn't care about being with the right people. I've seen him blow off invitations to hang out with TV stars and dodge the attention of world-famous rappers. But he does move in elite circles these days, hanging out with Michael Chabon, collaborating with David Simon, lunches with David Remnick. For the record, that's a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, the creator of The Wire, and the editor of The New Yorker.

Me, I work at home. I cut my own hair. And I definitely prefer burgers to oysters. And that's cool. This isn't about envy for me. I don't feel jealous. I've thought about it, and it's not that.

But it does feel weird, and I'm not sure why. And I just kind of wanted to understand that.

Neil Drumming
I guess in some ways, I have, like, fretted that, like, maybe we were losing pace with each other. Like I was kind of like--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
(SHOCKED) For food?

Neil Drumming
No. I mean-- but the food goes with a lot of other things. It's like, you know, it's not just the food. But it's like, thinking that-- you know, it's like maybe like lifestyle stuff.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
What else was I doing?

Neil Drumming
I don't know, like--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Going to France?

Neil Drumming
Staying at Chabon's house, stuff like that, just having these experiences that seem like--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean, he's a people, but it just-- I don't think I've changed, actually. So I just want-- like, how does this go? I stay at Chabon's house, and then I do what?

Neil Drumming
Nothing. That-- it's just--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
[LAUGHS] Like who do I come back as [INAUDIBLE]?

Neil Drumming
But here-- OK, but see-- I think that--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
What happens?

Neil Drumming
The embarrassing part about it is that it actually has more to do with, like, me. I don't know if I can communicate or, like, relate anymore.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
But we never had that problem, did we?

Neil Drumming
No, we never did. You just--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
How much of that is the divorce, though?

Neil Drumming
I don't know. Why-- explain. How do you mean?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Well, you had this huge rupture in your life, right?

Neil Drumming
Yeah.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
And your lifestyle changed. I mean, your lifestyle changes.

Neil Drumming
That's true.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean, you're out dating and doing, you know, whatever you're doing.

Neil Drumming
Yeah.

Things did get a little crazy for me after my divorce a couple years ago, more so than I'd like to admit. But it hadn't occurred to me that he would think I was the one who had changed, that that might be the reason for the distance between us. And after the divorce, Ta-Nehisi did keep reaching out. He'd call to talk about writing, or to get feedback on what he was working on, which was always kind of confusing to me.

Neil Drumming
I have to admit, I'm kind of like, well, you could also call David Simon, or any of these people who you have on speed dial--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Yeah, but my friends haven't really changed, you know that? Why would I call them? First of all, they're not smarter than you. I mean, I'm not trying to flatter-- like there's no evidence that they're smarter than you. Like the fact that they've gotten more, or had more accolades, it doesn't mean they're smarter than you.

Neil Drumming
In anyone else's perception in the world, right, they are. You know what I'm saying? They are. They would be. Those people would be. Those are--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
But I don't think-- I haven't talked to them. Out of respect for them, I don't think they think they are. But I don't think that's their perception of themselves.

And I'm gonna-- I am sensitive to this right now, like right now, because of what's going on. People put shit on you, man. They put shit on you.

Neil Drumming
What do you mean?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Well, the world talks about you in a certain way, and it becomes very easy to confuse what everyone says about you with how you actually think of yourself.

Neil Drumming
M.. I think it was wanting to feel like we're still on the same level, which has not-- it's not an intellectual thing as much as it is, like-- it is an intellectual thing because our friendship is intellectual.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Right, right, right.

Neil Drumming
That friendship is heartfelt and true, but also, like, the way we come up is ideas. Like you and I have a kinship of ideas, you, me, and Rick.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Right.

Neil Drumming
And we've always had that. And so when I feel-- so like having an intellectual disparity makes that friendship feel tenuous to me. I think I was afraid to say that to you, because I was afraid that would actually upset the friendship.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I don't know, man. You know, like the other part of that is it's just not-- I'm happy to be at The Atlantic. I'm happy that this book got published. I gotta tell you, all the other shit don't make me very happy.

Neil Drumming
OK, now this is probably not for the tape. But this is some shit I thought of, and it really hit me this weekend, or last weekend. Because I realized that I was doing a lot of intellectual gymnastics in my head about how I felt about us, and I realized I've seen you a bunch of times since then, and you're going through something, and I'm not asking you if you're OK. And I haven't asked you, like, if you're--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
No, I'm not OK. [LAUGHS]

Neil Drumming
And that's the thing that hit me, literally, like this weekend. I was like, wait a minute. I've been really selfish about this.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
No, it's all right. No, I'm not. I mean, I don't want to-- look at this shit. I was in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Look at this shit.

Neil Drumming
OK, so for the tape, just for the record, I'm looking at a billboard of Ta-Nehisi Coates-- that's a young pic. You're, like, 12 in that picture.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
No, it was like-- they took it when I first got to The Atlantic.

Neil Drumming
Oh, OK. So this is a picture--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Maybe I'm 33.

Neil Drumming
--of a young Ta-Nehisi Coates hanging over a freeway in Kalamazoo, Michigan. "Ta-Nehisi Coates, November 3, Miller Auditorium." Holy shit.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
She must want to know, is she seeing that?

Neil Drumming
OK, so what's the good in that? What's the good in that and what's the bad in that?

Ta-Nehisi Coates
I mean, the good in that is that, um-- the message is going to a lot of people. Like, what you write is clearly, on some level, being received by a lot of people. The bad in that is my face.

Neil Drumming
Ta-Nehisi doesn't like having his face on a billboard. He doesn't like being recognized in the street. I know the guy. I don't have many people in my life I know as well as him. He's never wanted to be famous or celebrated. In that way, he's right. He hasn't changed.

He and I talked for two more hours, and it felt like it always has. But we've lost a lot of the other stuff, the stuff that makes most friendships work. We don't go to the same parties or eat in the same restaurants. We don't share as many friends. He's raising a kid, and I just quit Tinder. We don't even live in the same country. Without all of that, what we have left feels more delicate.

So now I have another worry. I worry that the conversation that I just forced us to have, where I made such a big deal out of our differences, has in some way screwed with that friendship even more.

I went to see Ta-Nehisi speak at the Schomburg Center in Harlem. It was the first time I'd been to one of his public appearances in a very long time. The line outside was around the corner. When the audience was let in, they spilled over into a different room. 9,000 people had RSVP'd for 350 seats. Ta-Nehisi was engaging and provocative on stage. I felt proud. He was nice on the mic, and the crowd loved him.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
It's very, very important to me that I remember to go back to that and not enroll myself in my own judgment.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about it.

Neil Drumming
Afterwards, I waited outside the green room with Ta-Nehisi's wife and a handful of his friends, some from his Howard days. Celebrities like Common and Usher were there as well, pressing to get backstage to meet him. I chatted with his son, Samori, my godson, about how he was liking Paris. He was having girl trouble. Like his dad used to, I joked.

We had dinner reservations at Red Rooster in Harlem, but it was live jazz night and they wanted us to pay to be quiet. Ta-Nehisi wasn't having it. Later he'd say the joint was bougie. So we went down the street to Sylvia's and had a great time.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
We gotta go, babe.

Kenyatta Matthews
Bye, guys.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
All right, talk to you.

Neil Drumming
I'm not gonna see you for--

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Hey, man, thanks for hanging, man.

Neil Drumming
Of course, man.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
You had a good time?

Neil Drumming
Yeah, of course, man.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
OK. All right, cool. OK.

Kenyatta Matthews
All right, let me give you a quick hug. It was good seeing you.

Neil Drumming
[INAUDIBLE].

Kenyatta Matthews
Oh, you are.

Ta-Nehisi Coates
Catch you soon, brother.

Neil Drumming
All right, man. Let me know when you get back.

Ta-Nehisi climbed into a black SUV, went back to his hotel, and hopped on a plane the next morning. I stood on the street, fumbling with my recorder. For some reason, it took me a really long time to figure out how to turn it off. Then I headed home to Brooklyn. I don't know what's going to happen next.

Ira Glass
Neil Drumming is one of the producers of our show. Coming up, an entire town gets a status update, and they are not super stoked about it. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.

Act Three. There Owes the Neighborhood.

Ira Glass
It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on the program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program-- "Status Update."

Today's program is about people whose position in the world changes, in one way or another, and how they deal with it. So far on our show, we've had a literal status update, the social media kind. We've heard what it sounds like inside a friendship where there's been a major shift in status.

And now we've arrived at Act Three of our show. Act Three, There Owes the Neighborhood. In this act, we're going to look at an entire city getting a status update. And the man who gave this city the news about itself was named Paul Kiel. Before the city knew, Paul Kiel knew. And before Paul Kiel knew, nobody knew.

Here's what happened. Paul's an investigative reporter with ProPublica. And he discovered that over the last 15 years, this new kind of debt collector has become more prevalent. These are companies that go after people who owe on their credit cards, or car loans, or hospital bills, or whatever.

And these companies, what they do is they garnish people's wages. They garnish their wages. They take the money right out of their paychecks. Sometimes they go straight into their bank accounts and take the money.

They got this power by taking these people to court. Way more consumers who owe money are being taken to court. These companies sue those consumers, which used to be rare. They sue, and they win. And because they win, they get the power to garnish these wages.

OK, so figuring out that part was just the beginning. Chana Joffe-Walt talked to Paul Kiel.

Chana Joffe-walt
It was a struggle to get numbers on wage garnishing. How many people? How much money? Where were those people? Paul Kiel loves this kind of thing. He's an even-measured guy who enjoys the grunt work of tracking down which file cabinet in which municipal building of which small town has the information he needs.

Eventually, Paul and his colleague Annie Waldman had managed to track down the names and addresses of every single person who'd been sued for not paying their debts in three cities-- Newark, Chicago, and St. Louis. They put all that information into the computer, and then Paul looked at what they had.

Paul Kiel
Without doing a fancy analysis, if we sorted our neighborhoods so that the ones that had the most lawsuits were at the top, it was all black neighborhoods.

Chana Joffe-walt
In Newark, Chicago--

Paul Kiel
In Newark and Chicago and in St. Louis.

Chana Joffe-walt
All of them.

Paul Kiel
All of them.

Chana Joffe-walt
So there were way more lawsuits in black neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods.

Paul Kiel
Yes. That was clear no matter how you looked at it. In neighborhoods that had the same income level, the same household income, on average, we were finding twice as many lawsuits in the mostly black neighborhoods. And then it was a real question of why.

Chana Joffe-walt
Paul knew people would look at this and think what I thought. This is just discrimination-- companies targeting black people and black neighborhoods.

Chana Joffe-walt
Did you think this was just racism?

Paul Kiel
No, I didn't. No, I didn't jump to that conclusion, just because I know how it's such a large and impersonal system. You know, debt-buying companies and other banks might never meet their customers. You're literally a name on a spreadsheet to these companies. So it was immediately like a puzzle that we needed to find an answer to.

Chana Joffe-walt
Paul's first clue to the answer came when he went to a place called Jennings, Missouri. Jennings is a suburb of St. Louis, home to an astonishing amount of wage garnishing. And Jennings is where Paul met Cori Winfield.

Cori Winfield
Oh my god. OK, so like an example.

Chana Joffe-walt
Cori was the first person to show Paul her paycheck. She works for a brokerage services firm in St. Louis.

Cori Winfield
I just got paid Friday. And my check is usually, gross, around $1,100, $1,200, something like that. But when I got my-- when I got paid Friday, I had $691 on my check. My rent is $750.

Chana Joffe-walt
Here's how this happened. Cori was married-- four kids and a neat brick bungalow under a shady tree with a patch of grass just large enough to be called a lawn. She had a mortgage on that brick bungalow, and she had a van she bought in 2009 for $8,000. The loan on that van is the one that got her in trouble. That's the loan Cori's now paying for out of her paycheck.

So the lender in this case was Midwest Acceptance, which is like a St. Louis-based, mostly subprime auto loan company.

Chana Joffe-walt
Midwest Acceptance.

Paul Kiel
Midwest Acceptance, yes.

Chana Joffe-walt
Subprime meaning high interest rate. Really high-- 30%. In 2010, Cori stopped paying the car loan. And she stopped paying it for a bunch of reasons. Her husband left, so she had to carry the car loan and the mortgage on the brick bungalow with the small patch of grass all by herself.

Also, Cori's stepfather died. She got a new boyfriend. Her boyfriend was killed. She took a brief absence from work. One of her dogs died. She describes herself at this time as very distracted.

Cori Winfield
So I wasn't keeping up with court dates. I wasn't paying attention to the notices they were sending in the mail.

Chana Joffe-walt
And they were sending lots of notices. They were calling, too.

Cori Winfield
Midwest Acceptance. And they'd be like, um, when are you going to be in to make a payment? I'll be in, um, on my next pay period.

Well, we need you to come in before then. You're going to have to do something. You don't got a grandma you can call? You don't got a mama you can call? Or little stuff like that.

Chana Joffe-walt
The grandma. This turned out to be Paul's answer. Cori did have a grandma she often called, but her grandma was already trying to help Cori save her house. And she was helping Cori with car rides once Midwest repo'd Cori's car.

Her grandma was also helping Cori's mom and her uncle. And she was doing all that on a pension. Cori's grandma was the only person she'd ever been able to call in this kind of situation.

If you ask people, could you borrow $3,000 from a friend or family member in an emergency? White people are much more likely to say yes. Poor whites, a white person living in abject poverty, has roughly the same ability to borrow $3,000 in an emergency as a middle-class black person. That's according to the largest national survey of consumer finance. If you compare Jennings, where Cori was, to white towns where people make the same amount of money?

Paul Kiel
In that income bracket, whites, on average, have five times the wealth as black households.

Chana Joffe-walt
So wealth meaning home ownership and savings and investments and all of that stuff?

Paul Kiel
It's like everything you have that you could turn into money, whether it be equity in your home, or your car, or whatever. It was right in front of me. So if people in the same income level have five times the wealth, it seems very credible that that would have a major impact on whether they're able to deal with a debt. That, to me, is-- the answer's right there.

And you were asking me, like, well, is this because of discrimination? And we don't have direct evidence that these suits are happening more often in black communities because of discrimination, but the racial wealth gap is definitely because of discrimination.

So why do we have a racial wealth gap? Because we had centuries of racist public policy. And even in the 20th century, blacks were prevented from buying homes in certain areas, and there were a lot of policies that helped whites build wealth at the same time they were preventing blacks from doing that. So it was-- it's a wealth gap that was fostered by racist policy, which we really haven't recovered from. Because wealth takes time to build over generations.

Chana Joffe-walt
Paul knew all of this before he started looking into wage garnishing. He knew this history, from Jim Crow laws all the way up through restrictive covenants in housing. He knew the data. But it wasn't until Cori that he considered it the answer to his puzzle.

Which is interesting. The wealth gap is such a basic old fact about America that it's become a saggy, meaningless phrase. "The widening wealth gap." "How to narrow the wealth gap."

Paul Kiel
It's kind of an abstract concept.

Chana Joffe-walt
And this is what it looks like.

Paul Kiel
Right. Yeah. And so this is one good illustration of that.

So I'm standing on a street. Standing on a street in the middle of Jennings, not too far from the high school.

Chana Joffe-walt
Paul found himself in a peculiar situation. He had a detailed spreadsheet, with addresses, listing everyone who hasn't paid their debts, how much they owed, and for what. Basically he had a map of the neighborhood he was standing in that included intimate details about people's financial lives.

Paul Kiel
About half the homes on this block have had a lawsuit against them.

Chana Joffe-walt
On some blocks, it was every other house. Sometimes there were a few in just one house. It was a social map of the neighborhood that was the opposite of the carefully curated status updates you usually see.

What Paul could see was something real and messy-- what was going on with people's finances. And he wondered, if you live here, do you just know about this? Or do you actually need to see the map to picture it?

Paul Kiel
There's a street-- there's a house at the end here.

Woman
How did you get my name?

Paul Kiel
Well, it was court records.

Woman
OK.

Paul Kiel
So--

Woman
They are public.

Paul Kiel
They are public, yeah. And--

Chana Joffe-walt
This woman, Devorah, had been sued for money she owed the Metropolitan Sewer District. But she did not know that they'd sued her next door neighbor, too. Up the street and around the corner, Paul finds a block party going on. He sees a guy barbecuing in front of his house, and he knows this guy was sued, too. But the guy doesn't feel like talking about it.

The next few people did talk to Paul about it, and the disruption that led to them being sued-- a health incident, a family issue. For Latanya Graves, it was when she lost her job.

Latanya Graves
At the time, I was just trying to get back on my feet. I was laid off from Western Union.

Chana Joffe-walt
And how they had no one to call who could help.

Paul Kiel
Well, I would say, did you know that there was essentially one lawsuit for every four people? And they would say, no, I didn't know that.

All these suits on this block.

Latanya Graves
Oh, on this block?

Paul Kiel
On this street.

Latanya Graves
Wow.

Chana Joffe-walt
This is a neighborhood where one in four people had been sued, and nobody knows that they're not the only one.

Paul Kiel
Definitely nobody knew. [CHUCKLES] Nobody knew the numbers, and definitely, there was universal surprise at how prevalent it was.

Chana Joffe-walt
Paul stopped by a brick bungalow, Cori Winfield's house. Only it's not her house anymore, because Cori lost the house to foreclosure after the car loan. It is now Rosalyn Turner's house. Rosalyn also has had her wages garnished. She was working at Walmart, and suddenly a quarter of her paycheck started disappearing.

Rosalyn Turner
Yes. After they started garnishing me, Walmart gave me a number to call. And I called them, and they wouldn't tell me much.

Chana Joffe-walt
And Paul learned something else.

Paul Kiel
She had been sued by Midwest Acceptance, as well. It was the same company that Cori had been sued by.

Chana Joffe-walt
Who used to live in the same house.

Paul Kiel
Who used to live in the same house. So it was like, jeez.

Chana Joffe-walt
Rosalyn didn't know about Cori. Cori didn't know about Rosalyn. Paul was giving an entire neighborhood a status update on itself. Not that he'd set out to do that, but there he was, letting people know where they stood, relative to one another, even sometimes within the same family.

Paul Kiel
It happened twice where I was like, who is X? And they're like, oh, that's my daughter. I was like, do you remember them dealing with a lawsuit from so-and-so? No. I mean, I found that-- yeah, even in the same house, people don't know.

Chana Joffe-walt
Like here, in Dora Byrd's house. Paul asks, who's Camille Lee?

Dora Byrd
That's my granddaughter. What's Camille Lee got to do with-- what's going on with that?

Paul Kiel
Uh, sorry.

Chana Joffe-walt
In this one family, Dora Byrd had been sued for debt, her daughter had been sued for debt-- now she was learning her granddaughter had been sued for debt. Dora Byrd would try to help her granddaughter, now that she knows, but it will be hard, because a third of Dora's savings was garnished, too.

On his last day in Jennings, Paul stopped by a brick house with three lawsuits.

Paul Kiel
Yeah, so I went and knocked on the door, and a woman answered the second time we tried.

Chana Joffe-walt
Miranda Jones. She welcomed him in.

Paul Kiel
We went around her backyard. Then I learned that she is a councilwoman. She's a council member in Jennings, which was a surprise.

Chana Joffe-walt
Although it made sense, given the fact that she seemed to be commanding various operations by cellphone on a Saturday.

Miranda Jones
It's on my desk. It's on my desk.

Chana Joffe-walt
Paul tells Councilwoman Jones about his data.

Paul Kiel
She said, you know, you should talk to the mayor. And so she texted the mayor while I was talking to her.

Chana Joffe-walt
The mayor called right back.

Miranda Jones
Hey, Yolanda. Hey. I got a question for you. So there's a reporter that knocked on my door. He's from the--

Chana Joffe-walt
The mayor said she'd be happy to meet Paul in her office.

Paul Kiel
And then I drove right over to City Hall.

Chana Joffe-walt
They sat down in the council chambers.

Paul Kiel
I thought we were going to have like a kind of broader, 30,000-foot-- sort of the broader issues, like, what is this doing to my community as mayor? Like, that's the conversation that I thought we were going to have.

Chana Joffe-walt
And what happened?

Paul Kiel
So we started that way, and then she just kind of casually threw in the conversation that "I've been sued by the sewerage district, too."

Yolanda Henderson
I'm going to be honest with you. I was one of the ones that was sued, as well, falling behind because I didn't have-- you know, I lost my job.

Paul Kiel
And I tried not to-- I don't think I reacted in any way, because I try not to. But yeah, I was surprised, and I was-- it's almost like unbelievable at this point. And then at that point, I turned around and I wrote down the names that I saw, like on the name-- so we were in the city council chambers. It shows what all the names of all the city council members are. So I wrote all their names down and I was like, OK, when I get home, I'm going to look at the database and see how many city council members had actually been sued.

Chana Joffe-walt
How many?

Paul Kiel
So it was five of the eight city council members had been sued over a debt. It's to the point where, yeah, it's unbelievable how common it is.

Chana Joffe-walt
This should not be unbelievable by this point, right? Because Paul knows the data, has walked the streets. He's stared at the map. But still, it feels unbelievable. To the mayor, too, the mayor who has detailed knowledge of this particular community, who has experienced this herself. When Paul showed her her own block on his laptop?

Yolanda Henderson
Wow. See, that's my neighbor across the street. [INAUDIBLE] is right--

Paul Kiel
You get a sense that literally like--

Yolanda Henderson
Every other house.

Paul Kiel
Yeah. It's funny--

Yolanda Henderson
They're just suing all of us.

Chana Joffe-walt
"They're Just Suing All of Us." That was the front-page headline of the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Paul wrote a story for the paper about all this last month. So now, this thing that no one ever talks about, no one wants to talk about, that everyone is just keeping as their own private shame, was out. What happens then? How does this unusual and sudden sort of status update change things?

Yolanda Henderson
It was kind of like-- it was sad, but then it was kind of like a relief. Because I'm like, oh my goodness, you know?

Chana Joffe-walt
This is the mayor, Yolanda Henderson.

Yolanda Henderson
To see that long list, it was just-- wow.

Chana Joffe-walt
But you haven't talked to people about it?

Yolanda Henderson
No. You know, it-- that's not like a common thing you just start talking about. Hey, my wages are getting garnished. How about yours?

Chana Joffe-walt
I heard this from a few people. Now that they know their neighbors are in the same situation, they still don't want to talk about it. It's embarrassing. Mayor Henderson had her mayor's wages garnished just six months after she was elected. A very awkward finance person had the unlucky job of telling the new mayor that she'd be seeing a deduction in her next paycheck.

And Mayor Henderson had some questions about what that meant, which she was too embarrassed to ask, for weeks. The mayor. Not some disempowered nobody-- the mayor. It wasn't until she was giving me a tour of City Hall that she decided to finally stop by the finance office again.

Yolanda Henderson
All right. She's going to interview-- I got to ask you a question. My question is, on the MSD part, is it every pay period, or once a month, that 25% taken out of my pay?

Finance Employee
That is--

Yolanda Henderson
Do you remember? I forgot to ask you. Was it every pay period, or just once?

Finance Employee
Every--

Yolanda Henderson
Every pay period. Mm-hmm.

Finance Employee
Every pay period.

Yolanda Henderson
See, if that's the case, that's not right. That's two weeks, every two weeks. That's $300 and some. Mm-hmm.

Finance Employee
It's standard. It's standard. It's a percentage of the income after all deductions. So it is standard.

Chana Joffe-walt
It is standard. Unsurprising. That was actually the most consistent reason people gave for why they don't talk about this. It wasn't that surprising.

They did find it surprising when they learned how many of their neighbors had been garnished. But then, just a few minutes later, it stopped feeling surprising. They already knew everyone around them had very little to draw on. It wasn't really a status update. It was just status quo.

Act Four. 76-Year-Old Quarterback Throws Hail Mary Pass.

Man
She was very popular. She was one of, you might say, the queens in high school, right?

Ira Glass
Do you know where you're going to do this? Do you know where you're going to ask the question?

Man
Yeah. Yeah, I know where and when.

Ira Glass
Where is it going to be? What can you say about that?

Man
At her home. Next week.

Ira Glass
And right before he left to fly and ask her the big question, he changed his plan. He decided that instead of asking her to marry him, he would just tell her his feelings and ask her if she wanted to be in a real committed relationship with him.

And he did it. And OK, I'm just going to cut to the chase. She turned him down. Turned him down flat. No interest at all.

She'd been married for 50 years. She didn't want it again, with him or anybody. Her life was full of friends. Didn't need it. That's what she said. Though, of course, that's basically the senior citizen way of saying, you know, it's not you, it's me.

He says, right at the beginning of his visit, he got a sign of where her feelings were when he made the suggestion for the week together.

Man
I said, the one thing I would like to do is to shut down the evening, if you didn't mind, by just dancing together, closing the evening down with maybe just 15 minutes or so of dancing. She didn't agree to that. She said, well, I'm not certain about that. That's something I'll have to think about.

And of course, she didn't agree to that. And I know why. She didn't want any emotions to be involved, perhaps even her own, you know?

Ira Glass
He was less sad about it than you might think, because he finally knew the truth, knew it was hopeless with her. He could move on. And he's kind of excited to move on. He says he knows now. If you meet somebody who's truly right for you, it shouldn't take years for both of you to recognize it and feel it.

Man
And if you don't, then it's time to cut it and run.

Ira Glass
Life's too short. He's hoping his status is going to change one more time.

Prologue.

Ira Glass
I don't know when I got this idea that a captain's log be pretty interesting to read. Probably it was from watching Star Trek as a kid. You know, they do that whole captain's log star date thing. But in fact, in real life, here on planet earth, most captain's logs--

Erik Larson
Usually they're incredibly boring. I mean, it's like, you know, it's really primarily meant to be a record of ships' positions, weather.

Ira Glass
That's the story on Erik Larson. He ran into this when he was writing a book about this hurricane that destroyed the city of Galveston in 1900. He thought that ships at sea might have interesting observations about the formation of this historic weather event, this storm. So he looked at lots of ships' logs.

Erik Larson
And I found it very frustrating, very frustrating. It was just, like, routine references. And meanwhile, here's this gigantic storm looming on the horizon.

Ira Glass
And why? What would they way in their logs?

Erik Larson
Nothing. They would just list, you know, some wind speed, wind direction. Sometimes I think that a ship could be passing Krakatoa when it was blowing up, and there would be no reference, except maybe a sudden change in the air temperature.

Ira Glass
A ship's log does record anything unusual that happens on the ship itself, any damage to the ship. But really, it's about legal and administrative responsibilities. If cargo's damaged, insurers are going to need a record, that kind of thing.

Which is why this one captain's log that Larson found really stood out. He was researching the sinking of the Lusitania for his book, Dead Wake. And he got his hands on the captain's log for the U-boat that sunk the Lusitania in 1915.

The prose is businesslike and direct, just like most logs, even in translation from the German. But this captain just includes way more stuff, like way more detail than other logs that Larson had read. When Captain Walter Schwieger spots the Lusitania at 2:20 submarine time, he notes four funnels and two masts.

Erik Larson
You know, starboard ahead, coming from south to southwest, it's steered towards Galley Head, which is a Maritime landmark there in the Irish sea. The ship is made out to be a large passenger steamer. Then he says submerged to a depth of 11 meters, and at full speed, took a course converging.

Ira Glass
So, so far, very matter of fact.

Erik Larson
Very matter of fact. Now, what's important to know here as well is that, meanwhile, what's happening aboard his submarine is total chaos. He's doing a fast dive, which, depending on conditions, sometimes involved having members of the crew race to the bow, run to the front of the submarine to add ballast.

Ira Glass
To add that extra weight.

Erik Larson
Yes. So he's doing this very fast dive. There's chaos aboard the submarine. There's a lot of energy, a lot of excitement.

Ira Glass
That human drama doesn't make it into the log, even this one. 2:35 PM submarine time, the ship that he's chasing turns starboard towards a town called Queenstown. He runs at the ship at high speed, which Larson says was actually not very fast at all. 3:10 PM submarine time, the log says he takes a clean bow shot at a distance of 700 meters. He names the kind of torpedo he uses and the depth adjustment he makes, the angle.

Erik Larson
"Torpedo hits starboard side right behind the bridge." There it is. That's the actual firing of the torpedo in the attack. Then, though, he starts in with a fairly elaborate-- at least for a German submarine commander-- narrative.

He's watching this now through his periscope. "An usually strong explosion or detonation takes place with a very strong explosive cloud. The cloud reaches far beyond the front funnel. The explosion of the torpedo must have been accompanied by a second one," parentheses, "boiler or coal or powder?" Question mark.

"The superstructure right above the point of the impact and the bridge are torn asunder. Fire breaks out, and the smoke envelops the high bridge. The ship stops." He's incorrect there, by the way. The ship continued at 18 knots because its engines were knocked out, and you need engines in order to stop a ship.

"The ship stops immediately and heels over to starboard very quickly." And he says, "immersing simultaneously at the bowel. Great confusion ensues on board. The boats are made clear, and some of them are lowered to the water."

Ira Glass
He means the lifeboats there.

Erik Larson
Yes, the lifeboats. "In doing so, some must have lost their heads. Some boats, full to the capacity, are lowered, touch the water with either stem or stern first, and founder immediately."

Ira Glass
This is actually happening as they're filling with water, capsizing, sinking. It is a grisly scene-- people throwing themselves off the ship into the water and getting sucked underneath the sinking vessel, people getting crushed by the lifeboats. 1,198 died.

Captain Schwieger watches through his periscope, and he can't actually hear anything. What he's seeing is like this terrible silent movie. 3:25 PM submarine time in the log.

Erik Larson
"As it seems as if the steamer will keep above water only a short time, we dived to a depth of 24 meters and ran out to sea." Now, what he means there is he doesn't have to hang around and fire another torpedo.

However, here he says the most controversial statement in is log. "It would have been impossible for me anyhow to fire a second torpedo into this crushing crowd of humanity trying to save their lives."

Ira Glass
"It would have been impossible for me to fire a second torpedo into this crushing crowd of humanity trying to save their lives." This sentence is controversial because he's never like this anywhere else in the log, never sympathetic to his enemies this way. He never expresses feelings like this in this log that's going to be read, you know, by his superior officers. Why say this?

Erik Larson
I don't know what to think. I would like to think that this captain had that level of remorse, right, and that he acknowledged it right there at the time. I don't think so. My money is on a post-patrol revision that he may have added that after the fact, after everybody recognized how much the world had been repulsed by this attack on men, women, and children on an unarmed passenger ship.

Ira Glass
But if you think about it, even this, it doesn't totally add up. Like, OK, sure, the rest of the world was horrified by the sinking of the Lusitania. But Schwieger lived in Germany, where this was celebrated, a huge victory.

Did he want to change the log because he thought like, OK, maybe they would actually lose the war and he worried about how this was going to look? Did he just not want this to be his legacy, how he'd be talked about 100 years later as, you know, I'm doing right this second?

Well, today on our program, we bring you captain's logs of various sorts. For every story in today's show, we found a terse, businesslike record of some kind of some event in the past. Some of these are historic events. Some of them are small and personal. And what we're going to do is we're going to go back and reconstruct what really happened, which is way more complicated and emotional than the logs.

From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us, mateys.

Act One. Cookies and Monsters.

Ira Glass
Act 1, "Cookies and Monsters." So part of what's interesting about reading captain's logs is then going back and piecing together the true story that they're only sort of telling. And that is what PJ Vogt does in this next story. He starts picking something apart and asking questions, and he ends up somewhere very different from where he starts. Here's PJ.

Pj Vogt
I've got a friend, let's call him Dale. Dale has a Gmail address that's pretty generic, like dsmith@gmail.com. And people with email addresses like these get a lot of emails that just aren't meant for them, like email wrong numbers. And this happens to him all the time.

Last time I saw him, he'd just gotten an email written completely in Spanish from a kid somewhere asking if he could turn in some work late. Dale's a nice guy, but he likes to play pranks. He likes to mess with people. So he answers the emails. Here's one he got a while back.

Dale
I think it started off, "Hey, ladies. To all Calgary area district commissioners and district cookie advisers." And then it started talking about how they had a bunch of stale cookies that they didn't know what to do with, and we've got to move them off the shelves. And if they're past the expiration date, then we can't use them in the next cookie campaign.

Pj Vogt
The emails continue. And Dale learns that the world of professional cookie advising, it's surprisingly bureaucratic. At the top, there's a national cookie adviser. But beneath her, there are provincial cookie advisers who report up. And then beneath them, there are district cookie advisers.

Dale has no idea what's going on here. But he decides the best thing he could do would be to reply with an intentionally stupid email, detailing a bunch of asinine solutions to the stale cookie problem. He suggests the advisers Sharpie over the expiration dates on the packages. He suggests they eat all the stale cookies themselves.

Dale
In my mind, I was thinking, no one's going to believe this. What a stupid email to write to somebody. Who would hire a person with suggestions like these?

Pj Vogt
Cynthia, who's the Calgary area cookie adviser, responds to Dale's email with complete polite cheerfulness. She sends him a cookie freshness calculator to help him sort his stale cookies from his fresh cookies. So Dale responds with even stupider messages. He was trying to make it more obvious that he was just kidding.

Dale
I said, "What's the status on the cookies? Yarr. Me so hungry," with a picture of Cookie Monster. And I think she responded something along lines of, "Those orders were supposed to go in a month ago. Or did I misunderstand your question?"

Pj Vogt
Rather than clarifying, Dale asks her, why are we even in the cookie advising business? He says, his clients, they're all about chocolate bars now.

Dale
And Cynthia responded, "Chocolate bars????" Question mark, question mark, question mark, question mark. All of my other suggestions were met with, like, oh, maybe I misunderstood or something. But this one was very emphatic. It was like, "Chocolate bars?"

Pj Vogt
It actually seemed like Dale had maybe touched a nerve. Because after that, cookie advisor world went completely quiet. Dale was bothered by this.

The original email he'd gotten had been meant for a woman named Debbie. What if he had gotten Debbie in trouble, or even just made her look bad?

Dale
I'm a little afraid. I'd like to think that, oh, they just got it sorted out, and now it's funny, and Debbie is in on the joke-- just people trying to do their cookie job.

Pj Vogt
I reached out to the woman who'd been trying to email Debbie, Cynthia, because I wanted to find out if Dale's prank had hurt anybody.

Pj Vogt
Hello?

Cynthia
Hello.

Pj Vogt
Hi, Cynthia?

Cynthia
Yes, it's me.

Pj Vogt
Hi, it's PJ.

Cynthia has multiple sclerosis, and it can be hard for her to talk. So her friend, Sheila, volunteered to help out. I read them the emails.

Pj Vogt
"And of course, the obvious solution is to eat them during our next member meeting. Please discuss with the rest of area, and I will forward your decision on to national. Thanks so much." Do you remember getting that?

Cynthia
You know, I don't, but--

Sheila
We get a lot of questions all across Alberta at Cookie Time. Often, they have suggestions that don't always fly. So we find a way to respond do them as best we can.

Ira Glass
Cynthia and Sheila explained that they were part of Girl Guides. In the US, we have Girl Scouts. Most everywhere else in the world, they call them Girl Guides.

Pj Vogt
If you know anything about Girl Scouts, you won't be too surprised by this. But Cynthia and Sheila have a way of talking that is just unrelenting positive. It's just the Girl Guide way. That's why Cynthia was so patient with Dale. It was her job.

But she was also very patient with me, even as-- for reasons that I don't quite understand-- I found myself explaining to her the entire pattern of events that had led Dale to email her.

Pj Vogt
I guess the email was meant for Debbie, but it went to a Dale.

Cynthia
Oh. Now it's starting to make a little bit of sense.

Pj Vogt
This helpful sunny tone, this Girl Guide voice, is hardwired into their original mission statement, which reads, quote, "A guide smiles and sings under all difficulties," end quote. Smiling and singing under all difficulties.

This sounds ridiculous to me, or at least it did, until I heard a truly crazy story about this exact thing, Girl Guides smiling and singing through incredibly extreme circumstances. I first heard about it from a woman named Janie Hampton. She's kind of a Girl Guide expert. She wrote a book about them.

Janie Hampton
Now I have to admit, when I started writing the book, I thought, you know, I'm going to make this a bit of a satire and laugh at them.

Pj Vogt
She says laughing at Girl Guides is pretty easy, because most people think of them as not particularly cool, too sincere.

Janie Hampton
What we call "naff" nowadays.

Pj Vogt
What's naff?

Janie Hampton
Sort of unfashionable, nerdy.

Pj Vogt
So Janie sets out to tease some nerds. But then she starts researching. And one day, she's deep in the Girl Guides' archive in their London headquarters, and she finds this old notebook.

It's small, 7" by 10". And the book's a handwritten log of nearly everything one Girl Guide troop did years ago.

Janie Hampton
And it said, we did skipping, and we did knots, and we did all sorts of jolly things. And then I came across this song that they'd written. And it said, "We sang our song yesterday. And it went, 'We might have been shipped to Timbuktu. We might have been shipped to Kalamazoo. It's not repatriation, nor is it yet starvation. It's simply concentration in Chefoo." And I thought, what on earth does that mean? Concentration in Chefoo?

Pj Vogt
Janie does not know where Chefoo is. But she's sure it's not in England, so she looks it up. Chefoo is-- was-- a place in China, a coastal city. It's a good 7,000 miles from London.

According to the guide's logbook, the song had been written and performed by a group of Girl Guides for a concert on Christmas day, 1942. The Christmas concert, Janie discovers, was held in Chefoo, but not at a school. The Girl Guides sang their song in a concentration camp. Janie was baffled.

Why would a concentration camp in China have a singing Girl Guide troop? So Janie starts digging. And she finds someone who was there, an actual witness, born in China, who ended up in the same camp as these Girl Guides, this Belgian guy.

Leopold Pander
Leopold Pander, 74 years old.

Pj Vogt
The problem is, it turns out he has absolutely no memory of his time there.

Leopold Pander
I tried to remember something, but nothing comes back to me.

Pj Vogt
Nothing, except for this nightmare he used to have when he was a kid. At the time, it hadn't made sense to him. But later, he thought it must have taken place at the camp.

Pj Vogt
What was the dream that you would have?

Leopold Pander
Well, I'm there in the hot sun, the blue sky. It's a brown slope. It's a browned earth. And there are big stones next to myself, dirty earth and people running all over the place.

Pj Vogt
Are there sounds?

Leopold Pander
No sound, absolutely no sound. Somebody picks me up, and then I wake up. That's all I remember. That dream came back very often.

Pj Vogt
Leopold grows up. And as an adult, he wants to know about this place that he used to dream about, and so he builds a website. He invites people to write in with memories of the camp. And the story he learns is pretty crazy.

Reporter
Japan's latest invasion of China, which has already lasted two years, is war on a huge scale.

Pj Vogt
So I did not know this, but during World War II, when Japan occupied China, they built concentration camps that were filled with American and British and other European civilians.

Reporter
Japanese put their prisoners of war to work.

Pj Vogt
Civilians who had been living in China. One of those camps was called Weihsien. That was Leopold's camp.

And among the inmates at Weihsien were a group of children. They were American and British. They were mostly the kids of missionaries. And they'd been studying at a boarding school called Chefoo. Japanese troops invaded Chefoo and captured the kids and eventually brought them to Weihsien.

Janie Hampton
With their teachers, but no parents. So about 150 children who, for four years, were in this camp, and the teachers had very sensibly taken with them books, paper, musical instruments.

Pj Vogt
And of course, one more thing.

Janie Hampton
Brownie uniforms, guide uniforms, all the things they thought, we're going to need this sort of thing to keep the kids occupied.

Pj Vogt
In the Japanese camps, there was very little food. Prisoners died of starvation. In Weihsien, imprisoned monks would smuggle in eggs, and then everybody would share them. And then they'd also have the kids eat the ground up egg shells just to get some extra calcium.

The log book Janie had found was the record kept by one of the Girl Guides' leaders. The leaders were called Brown Owls. This one was a woman in her 20s. And the tone of her writing was the exact same, cheerful, impervious to bad news tone that Dale's cookie adviser email thread had had.

This is the entry from the day they were marched into the camp. "Hello. What's this? Behind bars. Yes. It's Weihsien camp. Well, I guess there's a good deal of fun to be got out of this. Just the place to earn some badges."

According to the logbook, the Brown Owl ran the troop as if it were any other Girl Guide unit, concentration camp or not.

Janie Hampton
They were all told it doesn't matter how disgusting the food is, we still want good table manners. It doesn't matter how hungry you are, you're not going to steal. You're still going to do a good deed every day and help other people.

Pj Vogt
Obviously the grim sadness of life in a concentration camp should have overpowered this miniature world that the Brown Owls were trying to build for their young girls. But according to Janie, that's not what happened.

Instead, it was the Girl Guides who started to exert an influence on the adults around them. They lead by example.

Janie Hampton
It made a difference to all the adults in this camp and kept them going. The whole atmosphere was better because they had this very strong promise that they wouldn't stop smiling. They wouldn't give up. They would carry on singing songs. They would insist on everybody washing.

Pj Vogt
This is the point where I wondered, was this true? I didn't think that anybody was necessarily lying to me. I just thought probably the Brown Owl had left the bad stuff out of her log book. I figured she'd put the best possible spin on an awful situation. That's what Girl Guides do, right?

Mary Previte
Oh, the door's open.

Phia Bennin
Oh, hello.

Mary Previte
Come on in.

Pj Vogt
Fortunately, there's a woman who's still alive and remembers Weihsien. Her name is Mary Previte. She lives in New Jersey. I visit her with my producer, Phia Bennin.

Mary Previte
What can I tell you? Oh, by the way, can I pour you some tea? I am so bad about this. I get so busy talking that--

Pj Vogt
Mary Previte is a small, beautiful 82-year-old woman. She's also one of the happiest people I've ever met. I don't know if anybody I've interviewed has ever fully broken into song unprompted. Mary did-- seven times.

Also, unlike Leopold, Mary has a phenomenal memory. She told me about the day that Japanese troops arrived at her boarding school.

Mary Previte
The day after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the Japanese showed up on the doorstep of our school. They put seals with Japanese writing on everything-- the tables, the chairs, the pianos, the desks. Everything belonged to the Great Emperor of Japan.

And then they put arm bands on us. Everyone had to wear an arm band. A for American, B for British, whatever our nationality was.

Pj Vogt
The girls were eventually transferred into Weihsien. Mary became a concentration camp Girl Guide. This was over 70 years ago. But when Mary talks about the camp, she sounds like she's still there, like she's 12 years old again.

She said this story about the Brown Owls insisting on good table manners, absolutely true.

Mary Previte
So you're eating some kind of glop out of a maybe boiled animal grain-- because [CHINESE] is a broomcorn that the Chinese feed to their animals-- was often what they fed us. And you're eating it out of a soap dish or a tin can.

And here comes Miss Stark up behind us-- one of our teachers. "Mary Taylor, do not slouch over your food while you are eating. Do not talk while you have food in your mouth. And there are not two sets of manners, one set of manners for the princesses in Buckingham Palace and another set of manners for the Weihsien concentration camp."

Pj Vogt
Mary was separated from her parents, unsure of when she'd BE released, surrounded by pack dogs and men with guns. She says that she spent a lot of her time just thinking about earning merit badges.

In the winter, it would get cold, freezing. But no heat was provided to the prisoners by the guards. Instead, Mary and her friends had to go collect leftover coal shavings from the guards' quarters.

Mary Previte
I remember now the ritual of going to Japanese quarters to get the coal dust and carry it back.

Pj Vogt
Like making a new pencil from pencil shavings, except the coal is heavy. And it had to be passed bucket by bucket in a line of Girl Guides. Then the shavings were mixed with dust and water and dried in the sun. It was long, hard work.

And then at the end of it, you still had to go use that recycled coal in a pot-bellied stove and keep the stove lit so that everybody would be warm. It sounded horrible, like a childhood from a Charles Dickens novel. Except Mary remembers it as being surprisingly fun, a game she could win.

Mary Previte
I and my partner, Marjorie Harrison, we won the competition in our dormitory of which stove lighting team made the pot-bellied stove in the winter turn red hot more times than any other girl in the camp. Well, you know, here I am, 82 years old, and what do I choose to tell you? I won. The pot-belly turned red more times with me and Marjorie Harrison than any other girl in our dorm.

Pj Vogt
When you describe it, it sounds like you're describing summer camp instead of describing a concentration camp. Did it feel like summer camp? Did you ever--

Mary Previte
Well, I never was in a summer camp. So I can't give you a-- no, no, no, absolutely not. When you had guard dogs, bayonet drills, electrified wires, barrier walls, pill boxes with armed guards in them, you weren't in a summer camp. Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying this was Fun City. I'm telling you, we lived a miracle where grownups preserved our childhood.

Pj Vogt
There's reference in the logbook to the trouble the adults were having keeping it together, but you'd have to know to look for it. A scout leader writes one entry that reads, "Dear me, what a tragedy. Brown Owl had an attack of neuralgia. Let's hope he's better for our meeting.

Neuralgia's a nerve disorder. But what that actually meant was that the Brown Owl was having a nervous breakdown. Years later, Mary went and tracked down one of the grownups.

Mary Previte
I said, Miss Carr, what were you feeling when we were in a concentration camp? Well, all the grownups in the camp knew about the rape of Nanking, the atrocities that the soldiers had done when they came to the southern city of Nanking.

Pj Vogt
Japanese soldiers went door to door, systematically raping and killing tens of thousands of Chinese civilians.

Mary Previte
So they knew what could happen. The teachers knew what could happen. So I said to Miss Carr, what were you feeling? She said, well, I would pray to God that when they lined us up along the death trenches-- and they were outside the camp-- when they lined us up to shoot us so our bodies would fall into the death pits, that I would be one of the first so I didn't have to see it.

Pj Vogt
So there were two sets of prayers. At night, the grownups, many of them not much older than the kids themselves, prayed grimly for a fast death. And then they woke up in the morning and they sang songs with the kids, set the bouncy camp melodies.

Mary Previte
It was like you weren't going to be afraid if you could sing about it. We would sing, (SINGING) Day is done. Gone the sun from the sea, from the hills, from the sky. All is well, safely rest. God is nigh.

How could you be afraid when you're singing about all is well, safely rest, God is nigh? How could you be afraid of that?

So we were constantly putting things into music. Often, you know, there was a little bit of a twist of fun to it. One of the songs that we sang was, (SINGING) We might have been shipped to Timbuktu. We might have been shipped to Kalamazoo. It's not repatriation or isn't yet stagnation. It's only concentration in Chefoo.

Pj Vogt
There probably aren't many places on earth where you have less reason to be cheerful than a concentration camp. But it turns out, in a place like that, being able to be cheerful, to have a positive outlook, it's not dopey or silly. It's how you survive. How you tell the story matters.

Mary Previte
For example, one of the things that we sang when the Japanese were marching us into concentration camp was the first verse of Psalm 46. (SINGING) God is our refuge, our refuge and our strength. And on it goes. In trouble, we will not be afraid.

All of these words just sung into our hearts. That sticks. It's like you've got a groove sticking in the gramophone record. I am safe. I am safe. I am safe. That was just profound.

Pj Vogt
The first Chefoo brownies warded off despair for four years, until finally, on August 17, 1945, they were rescued.

Mary Previte
It was a windy day.

Pj Vogt
Mary remembers the American plane flying low over the camp.

Mary Previte
And the parachutes falling from the sky. All I knew was I was running to find whoever it was that was dropping out of the sky beyond the barrier walls.

Leopold Pander
I'm there in the hot sun. It's a blue sky. It's a brown slope. It's a browned earth.

Mary Previte
And the people went berserk.

Leopold Pander
People running all over the place.

Mary Previte
People were crying, screaming, dancing.

Leopold Pander
Somebody picks me up, and then I wake up.

Pj Vogt
Leopold says that the nightmare that used to haunt him is just his memory of that day, of being a four-year-old, lost and wandering around a riot of freed concentration camp survivors. Most of the people who are there on liberation day are now dead.

One of the dormitories at Weihsien's a memorial, but mostly this place exists as a footnote in some books on a website designed by a Belgian man and in the memories of the remaining survivors. It's a half disappeared world with a strong pull on the people who do still remember it.

A couple weeks ago at the grocery store, I watched a gang of Brownie Scouts rush down the pet food aisle. They had their uniforms on, covered in merit badges for public speaking and backyard astronomy. They were happy and safe in their own world, a million miles from Weihsien. I wondered if they knew what they might be capable of.

Ira Glass
PJ Vogt. He's the co-host of the podcast "Reply All," where this story came from, and which I am a big fan of. You can subscribe to "Reply All" on iTunes, or wherever you get your podcasts.

On July 28, "Reply All" is going to be appearing in Cast Party, which is a podcast festival broadcast live to movie theaters across the country. It also features "Radiolab" and "Invisibilia." Info and tickets at castparty.org.

Coming up, Aziz Ansari thinks you don't know how to text. And when he makes the case, I have to say, I think you're going to believe him. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.

Act Two. Romancing the Phone.

Ira Glass
It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme. We bring you different stories on that theme. Today's show, "Captain's Log," stories where we take the unemotional facts in logs and records of various sorts, and we look behind them at the much more emotional, complicated stories that they are so stoically documenting. We've arrived at Act Two of our program, Act Two, "Romancing the Phone."

Recently, my wife and I, we were texting some things to each other that were so intense that at the end she suggested we just delete all of our texts that we had ever written to each other ever. And it wasn't like we thought that anybody else was going to see our texts. It's like we just didn't want them to exist in this world any more.

We wanted that history of our conversation to vanish forever from the face of the earth, never think about it again. You know, it's like text messages are this little history. It's like they're our logbook of our interactions with people.

And of course, usually they're not so emotional. Usually they're pretty terse, which totally makes them perfect for today's program, because their terseness behind it, there can be a whole story.

And recently, a sociologist started to study this. This was not very traditional sociology. The sociologist Eric Klinenberg at NYU teamed up with a comedian, Aziz Ansari, to examine the texts that people send to each other right when they start dating. And they put out a book with her findings. It's called Modern Romance.

And what they did, they spoke to a few hundred people. Their research was conducted in focus groups, like 10 to 20 people in a room, in eight different cities. And then sometimes they would do a version of these focus groups on stage in front of audiences, in New York and Los Angeles.

What they would do is Aziz would get up, and he would do a little stand up. And then he would introduce Eric, like Eric was the next comic who was coming on stage.

Aziz Ansari
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Eric Klinenberg.

Ira Glass
So Eric would come up, and he would talk a little bit about previous work that he'd done. And he would drop this statistic, that in 1950, 23% of American adults were single.

Eric Klinenberg
And today, about half of all adults are single. About half of all of adults are single. And I live in Manhattan. And in Manhattan, one out of every two households has just one person.

Ira Glass
Several people in the audience go "hmm."

Eric Klinenberg
See, I got a "hmm," Aziz.

Aziz Ansari
Those are like big laughs for sociologists, when people are like, "whoo." Gasps. I imagine backstage at sociology conferences, it's just like, man, I got so many gasps.

Like, did you hear how many gasps there were? You hear how many rumblings there were after I dropped that statistic? Those are good stats, man. Those are great stats.

Now what Eric and Aziz were interested in was exactly what it is that people say to each other when they want to ask somebody out on a date. So at these shows, Aziz and Eric would ask people for their phones, and then they would take their phones, and they would read their text messages out loud to the crowd.

Those texts, that log, that was the raw data for their research. And if you think about it from a research perspective, texts are great, because they are a real time record of what actually transpired, which is way more reliable and accurate than asking people later on to recall what happened. One of our producers, Jonathan Manjivar, dove into that data, and he now explains how those shows would go.

A quick warning before he starts, we're talking about dating. So there's nothing explicit in this story at all, but we acknowledge the existence of sex. Now here's Jonathan.

Jonathan Manjivar
This particular focus groups slash comedy show was recorded at the Upright Citizens Brigade theater in New York. The room had been split up so that all the guys were on one side. The girls were on the other.

And pretty quickly into the show, Aziz asked for volunteers to come up on stage. He and Eric specifically wanted guys who had recently made first contact with a woman they were interested in. How had the guys made their initial approach?

So four guys get up on stage. And then, one by one, they hand over their phones to Aziz.

Aziz Ansari
Pull up your text message exchange with these women. And what we want you to do is scroll to the very first message you sent to the women.

Jonathan Manjivar
Aziz starts reading texts. And the first guy, he'd been set up by his boss, not over text but over email. The email was sent to both him and his potential date. And it just said, "Cocktails, go get some." So this guy emailed the woman.

Aziz Ansari
You said, "Hey, Jared," that's his boss, "sure has a way of setting things up, dot dot dot, LOL. Would love to get a drink. When is it good for you, early next week or following Thanksgiving? My number is blah blah blah, by the way, if that is an easier way of communicating. And then she texted you, correct?"

Zach
A week later.

Aziz Ansari
A week-- a week later? Everyone's like [BLEEP] that [BLEEP] why'd you do that? So OK, so she said, "Hey, Zach," exclamation. "It's Collette, Jared's friend. I'm so, so sorry. I completely lost track of your email and forgot to respond. But--" no one believes her.

How many people don't believe that she really lost track?

Jonathan Manjivar
No hands go up.

Eric Klinenberg
That's insane. There's not one person that believes that someone could lose track of something anymore. OK. So she said, I'm sorry. I lost track of your email and forgot to respond, but I'd love to grab a drink if you're free this week. So she wrote that on Friday at 12:45.

Jonathan Manjivar
So the guy wrote back.

Aziz Ansari
"Hey, Collette, dot dot dot. Would love to get a drink, dot dot dot. Wednesday works well for me, dot dot dot. How about you?" Question mark. OK.

Jonathan Manjivar
OK, so Aziz moves on to guy number two, because what's about to happen is that we're going to hear all of their initial attempts. And then the women in the audience are going to vote on who did it best. Guy number two met a woman on the train one night.

Aziz Ansari
The next morning, he sent the message. This is what he said. "Hey, Audrey. This is Joe. Nice meeting you real quick last night. How are you?" Question mark. So that's his first message. And then--

Jonathan Manjivar
Moving on to guy number three, he had met a woman at an NYU alumni event.

Aziz Ansari
And then you wrote a message a few days later. And this is two messages, OK. You said, "Hey there. How'd your Thanksgiving feast turn out?" Question mark. "Here's a shot of the spread I put together. I'd say it came out all right." Smiley face. "Yo. I know it's tiny, but I promise, it looks delicious."

Jonathan Manjivar
Guy number four got someone's number at a wedding. She left the wedding. And then not long after, he texted her.

Aziz Ansari
Was this like a "hey, this is my number" type text? OK. So you say, "What's up? It's Theo." That's the voice your text has.

And then she said, "Hey, nothing much. Hey, NM. Just heading back home. How's the party going?" And then you set a few minutes later, "It's fun. You left too early. Ha ha. This was like [BLEEP]. I thought we were boning tonight."

Was that, like, what you were really thinking. Like, you know, we could have just-- so then, the next night, you send her the equivalent of your first contact, if you will. And you say, "It was cool meeting you last night. I'll be back in Cali in two weeks for winter break. We should hang out some time. Ha ha." It wasn't necessarily a Young Jeezy ha ha. It was just a ha ha.

Jonathan Manjivar
So four guys, which one did this best? Aziz and Eric turn to the women in the audience.

Aziz Ansari
Why don't we see which one do you guys like the most? Just the women in the audience. Clap if your favorite is this.

Jonathan Manjivar
So the clear winner, the guy who wrote about Thanksgiving. "Hey there. How'd your Thanksgiving feast turn out? Here's a shot of the spread I put together."

Eric Klinenberg
But could we find out from someone here what is so good about that text? If you voted for that text--

Aziz Ansari
Yeah, raise your hand.

Jonathan Manjivar
A woman in the audience, who's a little off mic, says it gets the conversation going. You asked a question. And he said something about his Thanksgiving, and it made you want to comment on it.

Aziz Ansari
OK. Anybody else?

Jonathan Manjivar
It was personal, another woman says. He remembered what you talked about.

Aziz Ansari
Personal, remember what you talked about.

Eric Klinenberg
You guys taking notes over there, by the way? Same time, we kind of need to know what didn't work out so well with the texts that nobody voted for.

Aziz Ansari
What did you not like about--

Eric Klinenberg
Oh, yeah, all the way in the back.

Jonathan Manjivar
The woman in the back doesn't like the "what's up" guy who met someone at a wedding and texted her after she left. In fact, no one liked that text. It got zero claps.

The woman says, it sounded like he just wanted to have sex. He's saying, I don't live here. But I'm going to be back. Let's hang out. And I don't want to talk to you until then.

Aziz Ansari
What do you mean? Why do you think he doesn't want to talk to her until then?

Woman 1
Because he would have asked a question.

Aziz Ansari
He would have asked a question. Does anyone else feel like that?

Audience
Yeah.

Aziz Ansari
Guys are like, must ask questions.

Jonathan Manjivar
Other than asking questions, Aziz and Eric have some very clear advice about the kinds of texts their research shows works when you're trying to ask someone out. Number one, invite the person to something specific at a specific time.

Two, say something that refers back to an earlier conversation you had, so it's clear you were listening. And three, say something funny.

Aziz and Eric say most guys, surprisingly, do not instinctually get this. They don't do it. But after dropping this knowledge at the show, women were invited to come up on stage to share texts they'd gotten from guys. And coincidentally, the very first woman received a text from a guy that followed two of the three rules.

Aziz Ansari
This was his first text to you. "Hey, how was the rest of your Thanksgiving?" Question mark. "You want to grab a drink tomorrow around 7:30 in [? LES?" ?] Question mark. That's a pretty-- whoa.

Woman 2
He's good.

Aziz Ansari
She just said, he's good. That's the bar for he's good. "How was your Thanksgiving? Do you want to get a drink Wednesday?" Oh my god. Who is this god?

Jonathan Manjivar
That guy got a date. Another woman got a text that was at the opposite end of the spectrum. The guy pretty much does everything wrong, from the start.

Aziz Ansari
OK. So his first message, "Hi." And then you have to go, "Hi, is this Connor?" I mean, this dude doesn't even want to tell his name. "Hey."

You said, "Hi. Is this Connor?" And he goes, "This is." Connor, you want to say some [BLEEP]?

"Hi. What's going on?" "I'm actually just waking up. Picking my mix up for my morning. So far, it's consisting of "Goodbye Horses" and "Big Pimping." And you're still being very nice.

"Oh, nice. Well, what are you up to tonight?" "Tonight, I'm not sure. I may want to eat some mushrooms."

No one is like, yeah, you should go out with this guy. Everyone's like, good decision. Way to go.

Jonathan Menjivar
OK, so to review, there are three rules. Ask a question. Make a specific plan. Be funny.

In fact, this night at the UCB theater, Aziz asked guys in the crowd to text someone they were interested in, right now, armed with this new knowledge. And just before the end of the show--

Aziz Ansari
Did any of you guys get a message back? Anybody?

Eric Klinenberg
Oh, come on.

Aziz Ansari
You did? OK. Oh my god. OK. OK, so you said, "Hey, I'm finally free from the horrors of math. Do you want to check out a new bar on Franklin next week?" Question mark.

She wrote back, six minutes later, "Yeah, for sure!" Exclamation. "I'm down. Also, next Thursday is my birthday. So I'm hoping to party it up next weekend." Smiley face. Holy [BLEEP]. We were right.

Thank you, guys, so much for coming out. We really appreciate it.

Ira Glass
Aziz Ansari. The book that he wrote with Eric Klinenberg is called Modern Romance. Jonathan Menjivar is one of the producers of our show.

Act Three. A Quiet Street in Richmond.

Ira Glass
Act Three, "On A Quiet Street in Richmond." So all through this hour today, we have documents that describe big dramatic things in the most "just the facts, ma'am" language possible, like a captain's log usually does. And we found this article from 1853 that's a good example of this.

In the article, a writer named William Chambers went out to witness and report on slave auctions. Apparently enough people had written about these in a very melodramatic and sensationalistic way that Chambers felt like somebody needed to go out and give a true, factual account.

John Ellison Conlee
Everything is described precisely as it occurred, without passion or prejudice. It would not have been difficult to be sentimental on a subject which appeals so strongly to the feelings but I preferred telling the simple truth.

Ira Glass
Our excerpts of Chambers' article were read for us by actor John Ellison Conlee. By 1853, slavery was controversial, and Chambers opposed it. He was a Scottish guy, an outsider.

And so he spent a couple days going from one auction shop to another in Richmond, Virginia. Chambers explains that he's seen advertisements for slave sales. And when he went to the addresses, he found a narrow short street between two main streets in the city, brick houses on either side where there were a few small auction shops.

On this particular day, it was pretty empty. Shops were identifiable by little red flags that hung outside their doors. And pinned to each flag was a piece of paper listing the men, women, and children who were going to be sold that day.

John Ellison Conlee
Conceive the idea of a large shop with two windows and a door between, no shelving or counters inside, the interior a spacious, dismal apartment, not well swept. The only furniture a desk at one of the windows and a bench at one side of the shop, three feet high with two steps to it from the floor.

Conceive the idea of this dismal looking place with nobody in it but three Negro children who, as I entered, were playing at auctioneering each other. An intensely black little Negro of four or five years of age was standing on the bench-- or block, as it is called-- with an equally black girl, about a year younger, by his side whom he was pretending to sell by bids to another black child who was rolling about the floor.

My appearance did not interrupt the merriment. The little auctioneer continued his play and appeared to enjoy the joke of selling the girl who stood demurely by his side. "$50 for the girl. $50, $50. I sell this here fine girl for $50," was uttered, with appropriate gestures in imitation, doubtless, of the scenes he had seen and acted daily on the spot.

I spoke a few words but was scarcely understood. And the fun went on as if I had not been present. So I left them, happy and rehearsing what was likely soon to be their own fate.

Ira Glass
At 9:30 AM, at another store, Chambers is approached by a salesman and asked if he's there to buy a slave. Chambers explains that he is not. He's simply there to witness the sales and gather information, which seems fine with the salesman. A lanky man sits down next to Chambers wearing what Chambers calls a wide awake hat, which is a hat with a kind of low round crown and a wide brim.

John Ellison Conlee
Looking towards the door, I observe the subjects of sale. The man and boy indicated by the paper on the red flag enter together, whence, as the day was chilly, they edge themselves towards the fire in the corner where I was seated. I was now between the two parties, the white man on the right and the old and young Negro on the left. And I waited to see what would take place.

The sight of the Negroes at once attracted the attention of Wide Awake. He kept keenly eyeing the pair as if to see what they were good for. Under this searched gaze, the man and boy were a little abashed but said nothing.

Their appearance had little of the repulsiveness we are apt to associate with the idea of slaves. They were dressed in a grey woolen coat, pants, and waistcoat, colored cotton neck cloths, clean shirts, coarse woolen stockings, and stout shoes.

Moved by a sudden impulse, Wide Awake left his seat and, rounding the back of my chair, began to grasp at the man's arms, as if to feel their muscular capacity. He then examined his hands and fingers, and last of all told him to open his mouth and show his teeth, which he did in a submissive manner.

Having finished these examinations, Wide Awake resumed his seat. I asked the elder Negro what was his age. He said he did not know. I next inquired how old the boy was. He said he was seven years of age.

On asking the man if the boy was his son, he said he was not. He was his cousin.

Ira Glass
Chambers and the man that he calls Wide Awake wait around for a while for the auction to start and then get tired of waiting. And they leave the shop to check out another one further up the street.

John Ellison Conlee
Here, according to the announcement on the paper stuck to the flag, there were to be sold a woman and three children, a young woman, three men, a middle aged woman, and a little boy. Already a crowd had met. A few were seated near a fire on the right-hand side, and others stood around an iron stove in the middle of the apartment. The whole place had a dilapidated appearance.

From a back window, there was a view into a ruinous courtyard, beyond which, in a hollow, accessible by a side lane, stood a shabby brick house on which the word jail was inscribed in large black letters on a white ground. I imagined it to be a depot for the reception of Negroes.

On my arrival, and while making these preliminary observations, the lots for sale had not made their appearance. In about five minutes afterwards, they were ushered in, one after the other, under the charge of a mulatto, who seemed to act as a principal assistant.

I saw no whips, chains, or any other engine of force, nor did such appear to be required. All the lots took their seats on two long forms near the stove. None showed any signs of resistance, nor did anyone utter a word. Their manner was that of perfect humility and resignation.

As soon as all were seated, there was a general examination of their respective merits by feeling their arms, looking into their mouths. Yet there was no abrupt rudeness in making these examinations, no coarse or domineering language was employed. The three Negro men were dressed in the usual manner, in grey woolen clothing.

The woman with three children excited my peculiar attention. She was neatly attired with a colored handkerchief bound around her head and wore a white apron over her gown. Her children were all girls, one of them a baby at the breast three months old, and the others two and three years of age, respectively, rigged out with clean white pinafores.

There was not a tear or an emotion visible in the whole party. Everything seemed to be considered as a matter of course. And the change of owners was possibly looked forward to do with as much indifference as ordinary hired servants anticipate a removal from one employer to another.

While intending purchasers were proceeding with personal examinations of the several lots, I took the liberty of putting a few questions to the mother of the children. The following was our conversation.

Are you a married woman? Yes, sir. How many children have you had? Seven. Where is your husband? In Madison County.

When did you part from him? On Wednesday, two days ago. Where you sorry to part from him? Yes, sir, she replied with a deep sigh. My heart was almost broke.

Why is your master selling you? I don't know. He wants money to buy some land. Suppose he sells me for that.

There might not be a word of truth in these answers, for I had no means of testing their correctness. But the woman seemed to speak unreservedly. And I am inclined to think that she said nothing but what, if necessary, could be substantiated.

Ira Glass
When the woman and her three children are put up on the auction block, bidding starts at $850. But it only gets up to $890. That won't do, gentleman, the auctioneer says. I cannot take such a low price. And the women and her children step down from the block.

$890 is the equivalent of nearly $26,000 today. Chambers reprints a price list. That's what one adult would sell for, not an adult and three kids.

The most interesting passage in Chambers' report is where he speculates about what the slaves feel about all this. Then in this passage he starts fine.

John Ellison Conlee
There was an entire absence of emotion in the looks of men, women, and children thus seated, preparatory to being sold. This does not correspond with the ordinary accounts of slave sales which are represented as tearful and harrowing.

Ira Glass
And then, Chambers takes a turn. He says something that is really hard to imagine somebody today writing.

John Ellison Conlee
My belief is that none of the parties felt deeply on the subject, or at least that any distress they experienced was but momentary, soon passed away and was forgotten. One of my reasons for this opinion rests on a trifling incident which occurred.

While waiting for the commencement of the sale, one of the gentleman present amused himself with a pointer dog which, at command, stood on its hind legs and took pieces of bread from his pocket. These tricks greatly entertained the row of Negroes, old and young. And the poor woman, whose heart three minutes before was almost broken, now laughed as heartily as anyone.

Ira Glass
Today, this just seems wrong-headed. Of course you could be deeply affected by something you're going through and still, you know, laugh at a dog doing tricks. Of course, any of us could contain both those things at the same time. It's weird that Chambers doesn't see that.

A scholar who's written about Chambers told me that Chambers was actually not a keen observer of people in his writing. He doesn't do much character observation when he writes. So it's possible he just was not super perceptive about people's feelings.

But also, when you read more of Chambers, it's clear he thinks that white people are superior to black people. He wrote, quote, "A black man is only a kind of man. He stands upright on two legs, his hands to work, wears clothes, can cook his food, a point not reached by monkeys," Chambers writes. "Perhaps," Chambers says, "there's something wrong with his craniological development," which, I guess he means, not as smart.

So he went on a mission to document the reality of slavery for his readers. He was that enlightened. He was that against it. But that was as far as he went. On his visit to Richmond, he was not able to see the people in front of him for what they really were, which was, of course, exactly the same as him.

Act Four. A Brief History of Us.

Ira Glass
Act Four, "A Brief History of Us." So to close today's show, we asked a fiction writer, Etgar Keret, to create a short story that works like a captain's log that's told completely through a series of unemotional facts. Here's what he wrote. It's read for us by actress Sue Scott.

Sue Scott
At first, we were a cell, then an amoeba, than a fish. And after a very long and frustrating era, we became a lizard. That was the era when, as we recall, the earth felt soft and unsteady beneath our feet. So we climbed a tree.

Up there in the treetops, we felt secure. At some point, we climbed down and started walking upright and speaking. And as soon as we began speaking, we just couldn't stop.

After that, we watched a lot of TV. It was a fantastic era. We always laughed in the wrong places. And people stared and said, what's so funny? And we didn't even bother answering. That's how little we cared.

We promised ourselves we'd find a job we loved. And when that didn't work out, we settled for a job we didn't hate. And we felt lucky, and then unlucky, and then lucky again.

And suddenly, our parents were dying. Then they died. A second before they departed, we held their hand really tight and told him we forgave them for everything-- everything. And our voice broke when we said that, because we weren't convinced we were telling the truth. And we were afraid they could sense it.

Less than a year after that, our son was born. And he also climbed a tree and felt secure up there. And he came down at some point, too, and went off to college. Then we were left alone, and it started getting cold, not like the other time eons ago when we hid in boroughs and peered out while the dinosaurs froze to death, but still depressingly cold.

So we went to a drama workshop, because our friend said it would do us good. They gave us a series of improv exercises. And in the first one, we poisoned each other. And in the second one, we cheated on each other.

And in the third one, the instructor, who spoke English with a heavy indistinct accent said, now switch partners. And within seconds, it wasn't us anymore.

The new man who was my partner said, let's do a sketch where you're a baby, and I give birth to you and nurse you and protect you from all evil. And I said, sure, why not? But by the time he'd finished giving birth to me and nursing me and protecting me from all evil, our time was up.

And the instructor with a strange accent asked if the exercise had made any primal memory surface. And I said it hadn't, because I didn't want to admit that it had brought back warm primordial memories from millions of years ago, from before we even emerged from the water.

Afterwards at home, we got into an argument over something really dumb and had the biggest fight we'd ever had since we were created. We yelled and cried and broke things, the kind of things that if you'd asked us a day earlier we'd have told you were unbreakable.

Then we packed our stuff up in a suitcase and shoved whatever didn't fit in the suitcase into plastic grocery bags. And we dragged all that behind us like homeless people to the apartment where a very wealthy friend of ours lived. And he put a sheet out on his plush sofa for us.

The friend told us that it might seem like the end of the world now. But by morning, all the rage and hurt feelings would melt away, and everything would look different. And we said, no, something had been broken. Something had been torn apart, something we would never be able to mend or forgive.

The friend lit an imported Slims cigarette and said, OK, maybe so. But can I just ask, why do you keep talking in the plural? Instead of answering, I just looked around and realized I was alone-- truly, completely alone.

I said, "What's the status on the cookies? Yarr. Me so hungry."

Ira Glass
I'm Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories of This American Life.

Ira Glass
So today we have a story that we think might make you believe something that right now you do not believe. And to tell that story, I'm joined here in the studio by NPR science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller. Hey there, guys.

Lulu Miller
Hi.

Alix Spiegel
Hello.

Ira Glass
And do I have this right? So you bought a rat, and you brought it to NPR headquarters in Washington, DC?

Alix Spiegel
We did.

Lulu Miller
Alix bought the rat.

Alix Spiegel
I did.

Ira Glass
And where at NPR did you bring the rat to?

Alix Spiegel
We ferreted it into a little kind of edit booth type thing--

[GIGGLING]

Lulu Miller
Hi, buddy!

Alix Spiegel
--type office. And we invited people into the room one by one.

Lulu Miller
So can you just describe what we got here?

Male Speaker 1
It's a rat.

Female Speaker 1
Pinkish ears.

Male Speaker 2
Red eyes.

Male Speaker 3
Long nose.

Alix Spiegel
And sat them down in front of this rat and asked this question.

Lulu Miller
Do you think that the thoughts that you have in your head-- OK, the private thoughts that you have in your head-- could influence how that rat moves through space?

Male Speaker 1
No.

Female Speaker 1
No.

Male Speaker 2
No.

Male Speaker 3
No.

Alix Spiegel
And it was almost unanimous. People did not believe that their personal thoughts would have any effect on the rat at all.

Male Speaker 4
Because that would suggest some sort of telepathy which I don't have.

Alix Spiegel
And Ira, maybe that's what you think too.

Ira Glass
That is what I think. I don't think that people thinking thoughts will affect a rat's behavior.

Alix Spiegel
Well, you're wrong.

Ira Glass
No.

Bob Rosenthal
(CHUCKLING) Yes.

Ira Glass
OK, so who's this?

Alix Spiegel
This is a man named Bob Rosenthal. He's a research psychologist. And early in his career, he did this thing. He went into his lab late at night and hung signs on all of the rat cages. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly smart. And some of the signs said that the rat in the cage was incredibly dumb, even though neither of those things was true.

Bob Rosenthal
They were very average rats that you would buy from a research institute that sells rats for a living.

Alix Spiegel
So then Bob brings this group of experimenters into his lab, and he says, for the next week, some of you are going to get these incredibly smart rats. And some of you are going to get these incredibly stupid rats. And your job is to run your rat through a maze and record how well it does.

Lulu Miller
Can you just pick up the rat?

Alix Spiegel
So, Ira, we actually did a very lo-fi, unscientific version of this in that little room in NPR.

Ira Glass
They let you do that?

Alix Spiegel
We didn't ask permission.

Male Speaker 4
Is that OK to do?

Lulu Miller
Yeah.

Alix Spiegel
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
And you've probably already guessed where this is going.

Alix Spiegel
Yeah. In Bob's real study, the experimenters ran the rats that they had been told were smart.

Female Speaker 1
She has sort of an intelligent looking face.

Alix Spiegel
And the rats they had been told were dumb.

Male Speaker 4
Yeah, he seems kind of lazy.

Alix Spiegel
It was not even close.

Bob Rosenthal
The results were so dramatic.

Alix Spiegel
In Bob's real study, the smart rats did almost twice as well as the dumb rats.

Ira Glass
Wait, even though they were the same?

Alix Spiegel
Yeah, even though the smart rats were not smart and the dumb rats were not dumb. They were all just the same average kind of lab rat. It was so shocking, people didn't really believe him.

Bob Rosenthal
I was having trouble publishing any of this.

Ira Glass
And so what was going on? Like, what was actually happening to make the rats do this?

Alix Spiegel
So what Bob figured out was that the expectations that the experimenters carried in their heads subtly changed the way that the experimenters touched the rats, and that changed the way that the rats behaved. So when the experimenters thought that the rats were really smart, they felt more warmly towards the rats. And so they touched them more gently.

Bob Rosenthal
We do know that handling rats and handling them more gently can actually increase the performance of rats.

Ira Glass
And how does this play out when it comes to people? How do our expectations of other people work?

Alix Spiegel
Well, what you saw in the rats totally holds for people too. I talked to Carol Dweck, who's a psychologist and researcher at Stanford.

Carol Dweck
You may be standing farther away from someone you have lower expectations for. You may not be making as much eye contact. And it's not something you can put your finger on. We are not usually aware of how we are conveying our expectations to other people. But it's there.

Alix Spiegel
And it happens in all kinds of areas. Research has shown that a teacher's expectations can raise or lower a student's IQ score, that a mother's expectations influences the drinking behavior of her middle schooler, that military trainers' expectations can literally make a soldier run faster or slower. So my question was-- you know, how far does this go?

Alix Spiegel
So Carol, clearly these expectation effects exist on a continuum. So for example, if I expect that if somebody jumps off a building, they will be able to fly, that's not going to work out so well, right?

Carol Dweck
Mm-hmm.

Alix Spiegel
So what does science know about where we should draw the line? Does it have a clear sense of that?

Carol Dweck
No. That line is moving. As we come to understand things that are possible and mechanisms through which a belief affects an outcome or one person affects another person, that line can move.

Ira Glass
Well, from WBEZ, Chicago, it's This American Life. Today on our program, we have a kind of hard to believe example of what expectations can do to people. This story is from a new radio show and podcast that Alix and Lulu are launching this week. It's called Invisibilia. It's about the invisible forces that shape human behavior, like beliefs and assumptions and emotions, which I know sounds a little abstract. But in execution, I have to say it is anything but.

Act One. Batman Begins.

Ira Glass
Alix used to work here at our program. Lulu worked at Radiolab, and their new show is sort of halfway between the two. A quick heads-up before they launch into this. As you may have noticed, their voices sound a lot alike.

Lulu Miller
They are.

Alix Spiegel
Sorry. Yeah.

Ira Glass
Yes, I know that is not news to the two of you at all. So stay with us. And Lulu, let's just jump right in. Where do you want to start?

Lulu Miller
Well, I'll start with a question that I asked the rat scientist, the expectations guy, Bob Rosenthal.

Bob Rosenthal
OK.

Lulu Miller
Could my expectations make a blind person who literally has no eyeballs see?

Bob Rosenthal
No way. The expectations will not make him see.

Lulu Miller
How sure are you about that one?

Bob Rosenthal
Positive.

Lulu Miller
So I'm deep in the woods of Southern California with a man named Daniel Kish. We've been hiking for hours, climbing over tree stumps and along the edges of a steep ravine. And we're just sitting down in the dirt to take a break.

Lulu Miller
Could we look at your eyes?

Daniel Kish
In terms of them being out?

Lulu Miller
Yeah.

Daniel Kish
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
And then Daniel pulls down his lower eyelids--

Daniel Kish
Let me just--

Lulu Miller
--and removes his eyes. They're prosthetic, of course, and they clink a little bit as he hands them over to me.

Lulu Miller
That's so cool.

Two of the most beautiful hazel-blue eyes I've ever seen in the palm of his hand.

Lulu Miller
Can I hold them?

Daniel Kish
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
OK. Is it OK if my hand--

Daniel Kish
Mm-hmm.

Lulu Miller
Wow. They are so lifelike. Does it feel odd to not have them in?

Daniel Kish
Yes.

Lulu Miller
Oh, it does?

Daniel Kish
Oh, yes.

Lulu Miller
OK.

Daniel's eyes had to be removed when he was just a toddler because of cancer.

Daniel Kish
Retinoblastoma, which is basically eye cancer.

Lulu Miller
And yet he's the one who's led me on this hike deep into the woods. We get to forks in the road, and he knows they're there. He leads me across a footbridge that's maybe two and a half feet wide without slowing down.

Daniel Kish
I think we've passed what I was looking for.

Lulu Miller
And over and over, the path takes us right alongside the edge of a cliff. And Daniel gets within inches but always senses it. So how does he do it? Well, he's got a cane and a hiking stick. But mainly--

Daniel Kish
[TONGUE CLICKING]

Lulu Miller
--he clicks.

Daniel Kish
You press the tongue on the roof of the mouth.

Lulu Miller
Is it kind of like [TONGUE CLICKING]?

Daniel Kish
You're creating a vacuum.

Lulu Miller
Huh.

He clicks with his tongue as a way of understanding where he is in space. This is basically what bats do. Echolocation, the scientists call it. It's like sonar. From the way those clicks bounce off of things in the environment, Daniel gets a sort of sonic representation of what's around him.

Daniel Kish
So here, [TONGUE CLICKING], I can sense trees poking up.

Lulu Miller
Now, Daniel just happened to intuitively invent this when he was a toddler. No one taught him or trained him. He just made it up. And since he's been doing it his whole life, he's now so good at it that he can tell all sorts of things about what's in front of him-- if there's a wall, if the vegetation is dense or sparse.

Daniel Kish
So here's a bench.

Lulu Miller
Yep.

Daniel Kish
Garbage bins.

Lulu Miller
Ding, ding, ding.

Daniel Kish
Outhouse.

Lulu Miller
Wow.

And not only does this allow him to hike--

Daniel Kish
So we'll go this way.

Lulu Miller
--navigate foreign cities alone, rock climb, horseback ride, but the one that gets all the attention is that he can ride a bicycle.

News Reporter 1
Meet Daniel Kish. He's blind, but that doesn't stop him from riding his bike.

Lulu Miller
You may have heard of Daniel Kish before.

News Reporter 2
Daniel Kish is completely blind.

Lulu Miller
He's usually called the Batman.

News Reporter 3
This real life Batman--

Lulu Miller
Because he is the man who clicks, like a bat.

News Reporter 4
His remarkable, bat-like abilities.

Lulu Miller
And he has made the media rounds to demonstrate what is usually described as his most amazing--

News Reporter 5
Extraordinary.

News Reporter 6
Phenomenal.

News Reporter 7
Remarkable.

Lulu Miller
--nearly superhuman ability of being able to ride a bicycle even though he is blind.

News Reporter 8
As you watch him, remember, he can't see a thing.

Lulu Miller
A narrative that Daniel thinks is all wrong.

Brian Bushway
(SINGING) Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee. Step right up! Step right up! The amazing Daniel Kish will demonstrate one of his greatest tricks to date.

Lulu Miller
This is Daniel's buddy Brian Bushway, who has had to watch his poor friend wheel out the old bicycle so many times for the media that he couldn't help but mock the whole set up when I asked him to do it for me.

Brian Bushway
And then he will proceed to mount himself on a bike and ride.

Lulu Miller
And though Daniel indulged, pulling figure eights and riding beautifully as I ran beside him with my microphone, the two of them made it clear that my amazement was kind of offensive.

Brian Bushway
So step right up, step right up, and see the amazing Daniel Kish do something that everybody can, but most people don't.

Lulu Miller
And here's where we get back to expectations. See, Daniel thinks there is nothing amazing about him. He thinks that most blind people who don't have other disabilities could do things like ride bikes.

Daniel Kish
I definitely think that most blind people could move around with fluidity and confidence if that were the expectation.

Lulu Miller
See, he thinks the reason that more blind people don't isn't just because they haven't learned to click. But it's because the expectations that you or I are carrying around in our own heads about what blind people can do are simply way too low.

Daniel Kish
They wouldn't be able to hike. They wouldn't be able to run. They wouldn't be able to engage in manual labor.

Lulu Miller
Daniel, like Bob, thinks those expectations, those private thoughts in our heads, are extremely powerful things, because over time, they have the ability to change the blind person we are thinking about.

Daniel Kish
That psychology becomes inculcated in the blind person, absorbed and translated into physical reality.

Lulu Miller
And so Daniel thinks if we could all change our expectations of what blind people are capable of, then not only would you see a lot more blind people on bikes, but--

Daniel Kish
More blind people could--

Lulu Miller
--in a very real way--

Daniel Kish
--see.

Lulu Miller
Yeah, he just said "see."

Daniel Kish
It's actually pretty simple and straightforward.

Lulu Miller
And it turns out neuroscientists are looking into this idea and seeing some pretty shocking results. And we'll get there. But first, to understand what Daniel means, how expectations could give a blind person vision, we need to first see how Daniel himself shot through this forcefield of low expectations, a story which starts back in 1967, when Daniel was 13 months old, and that second eyeball had just been removed.

Paulette Kish
Oh, my gosh.

Lulu Miller
This is Danielle's mother, Paulette Kish. And a few days after taking her son home from the hospital, Paulette realized she was facing a really difficult choice.

Paulette Kish
My mom thought that I should put him in cotton.

Lulu Miller
Cotton?

Paulette Kish
Wrap him in cotton so that he didn't get hurt, so that he was so protected. That's really how she felt.

Lulu Miller
See, Daniel was a very rambunctious little guy.

Paulette Kish
He started climbing when he was six months old, before he even walked.

Lulu Miller
And that didn't change when he went blind.

Paulette Kish
We had bookshelves he would climb, so I'd have to move everything off the bookshelves, because he would get into them.

Lulu Miller
So Paulette needed to decide, was her mom right? Was it time to start putting some restrictions on him, or was she going to raise him like a seeing child, allow him to explore his world with very few restrictions on him for blindness? And Paulette went with option two. She was going to banish her fear.

Paulette Kish
Just put it away. In the beginning, I think that's what I did. I just put it away.

Lulu Miller
And so, when two police officers showed up at her door--

Paulette Kish
Two big, huge police officers holding my child.

Lulu Miller
--having picked up Daniel for climbing the fence into their neighbor's yard--

Paulette Kish
You can't let him do that. He could fall.

Lulu Miller
--Paulette felt their same worries--

Paulette Kish
It's very scary.

Lulu Miller
--but didn't make Daniel stop.

Daniel Kish
I just climbed everything I could find.

Lulu Miller
And when the elementary school called and asked her to make Daniel stop clicking--

Paulette Kish
It's not socially acceptable, is what they would say.

Lulu Miller
--Paulette said, too bad.

Paulette Kish
He needs to know what's around him, and that's how he does it.

Lulu Miller
And so Daniel clicked, [TONGUE CLICKING], past people doing double takes on the street, [TONGUE CLICKING], occasionally bumping into things.

Daniel Kish
(CHUCKLING) Yep.

Paulette Kish
And then pretty soon--

Lulu Miller
Your blind kid is not only scaling trees and fences by himself, but using just his clicks-- not even using a cane at that point-- he's walking to school by himself, crossing busy roads, exploring his way into neighbors' driveways.

Daniel Kish
A friend of the family had an undersized bike, and I started riding alongside this retainer wall, until I realized I didn't really need the wall and I could roll alongside the wall without having to touch the wall. And then--

Paulette Kish
Oh, goodness.

Daniel Kish
I just could ride it.

Lulu Miller
He'd have to click way more than usual.

Daniel Kish
Peppering the environment with a barrage of clicks. [TONGUE CLICKING]

Lulu Miller
But by six years old, he could do it-- ride completely comfortably on the bike.

Daniel Kish
[CHUCKLING]

Lulu Miller
And when neighbors would pop their heads out the door--

Paulette Kish
How can you let him do that?

Lulu Miller
--with their concerns--

Distorted Voices
How can you let him do that? How can you let him do that? How can you let him do that?

Lulu Miller
--she'd look at his smiling face--

Daniel Kish
[CHUCKLING]

Lulu Miller
--and think--

Paulette Kish
How can I not?

Alix Spiegel
Hey, Lulu?

Lulu Miller
Yeah, Alix?

Alix Spiegel
Can I cut in with a question?

Lulu Miller
Yeah.

Alix Spiegel
Did he ever get hurt? Like, really hurt?

Lulu Miller
Well--

Daniel Kish
I used to have this game, get to the top of our road and yell, dive bomb, and I would ride insanely fast down the road. And everyone would have to scatter. Well, one day, I did the dive bomb thing, and as I was screaming down this road, bang. I just collided into a metal light pole.

Lulu Miller
Oy.

Daniel Kish
Blood everywhere.

Lulu Miller
And this was not the only pole in Daniel's life. On the schoolyard, he ran into a pole and knocked out his front teeth.

Daniel Kish
Teeth.

Lulu Miller
A few years after that, he ran straight into a soccer shed.

Daniel Kish
And it just destroyed my whole mouth.

Lulu Miller
So yeah, he got injured pretty badly a bunch of times. But the way that Paulette reacted to these injuries--

Paulette Kish
Mm-hmm.

Lulu Miller
--was that she always let him keep going. I mean, shortly after the bike thing, a bicycle appeared under the Christmas tree.

Alix Spiegel
And, like, I am a mother, and I think that if my kid kept showing up with his front teeth knocked out, I would begin to wonder if I had made the right choice.

Lulu Miller
Yeah. Paulette knows it seems extreme, which brings me to the reason she decided to do this, to raise her blind kid so differently from the way that most blind kids are raised.

Paulette Kish
It was my first marriage. It was not a good marriage.

Daniel Kish
My father was an alcoholic, and he was abusive.

Lulu Miller
Daniel's biological father, who's now dead, would hit Paulette.

Daniel Kish
Sort of a barroom brawler type.

Lulu Miller
And he was tough with Daniel and Daniel's little brother, taught them to fight.

Daniel Kish
And we had to learn to sort of take physical punishment, as it were, and be able to dish it back.

Lulu Miller
And Paulette says this is why she ended up being so hands-off with Daniel.

Paulette Kish
[SIGH] Everything that happens in your life has its effect, has its effect.

Lulu Miller
She says that after years of feeling so small and powerless in that marriage, when she finally made it out, she vowed never to be ruled by fear again.

Paulette Kish
I mean, there's life, and then there is living your life. There is a difference.

Lulu Miller
And the same would go for Daniel. She refused to let those scary thoughts of what could happen make her keep Daniel too close.

Lulu Miller
But what if Daniel ended up being hit by a car and killed?

I asked her.

Lulu Miller
Like, what if-- what if a car just hits and just plows him down?

Paulette Kish
But that could happen to anyone. That could happen to anyone. There was a group of four kids on the corner up about a block, a car went up the curb and hit them, killed two of them. It could happen to anyone.

Lulu Miller
And so bikes were bought for Christmas.

Paulette Kish
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
And tree climbing was permitted.

Paulette Kish
OK. I'll just close my eyes.

Lulu Miller
And this blind little boy was allowed to wander the world as freely as any sighted child.

Daniel Kish
From the fifth grade on, I walked to school almost every day. I had to cross major streets. I participated in extracurricular activities. I made my own breakfast. I made my own lunch.

Alix Spiegel
I mean, were they considered outside the norm? Did they consider themselves outside the norm?

Lulu Miller
I don't think they noticed it much. I don't think they thought about it much. Particularly Daniel didn't know that there was anything odd about the way he got around the world.

Daniel Kish
Until Adam.

Adam Shaible
My name is Adam Shaible. Excuse me for a second.

Lulu Miller
So Alix?

Alix Spiegel
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
This is where the story takes a kind of complicated turn, because Adam is basically the first other blind person that Daniel ever encounters. They meet in the fifth grade, when Adam suddenly enrolls in Daniel's school.

Adam Shaible
I will say, I was a rather small fellow at the time. When I was 11, 12, I was under 60 pounds.

Lulu Miller
Wow.

And Daniel was not exactly welcoming.

Adam Shaible
He just wasn't a nice-- a nice fellow.

Lulu Miller
Daniel said that Adam completely unnerved him because of how incapable he was of getting around on his own.

Daniel Kish
Literally just running into walls. I mean, he would just walk along, and his forehead would connect with a wall. And we'd be on the other side of that wall, and we would say, OK, that's Adam, he's coming, kind of thing.

Lulu Miller
Is that true? Was it, like, that bad?

Adam Shaible
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
Adam says he had simply never needed to get around on his own before.

Adam Shaible
I went to the School for the Blind from age five to age seven.

Lulu Miller
And there, he was taken around on someone's arm almost all the time. In the lunchroom, people brought him his food. They helped him carry his books, helped him tie his shoelaces.

Adam Shaible
I don't know why people did things for me. They just did.

Lulu Miller
And Daniel was baffled by Adam.

Daniel Kish
At the time, I had not really conceptualized blindness in that way for myself. And I just didn't understand it.

Lulu Miller
He'd come home to his mom mystified.

Paulette Kish
He'd say, Adam can't do anything on his own.

Adam Shaible
If I got lost, I used to get terrified.

Daniel Kish
Why?

Adam Shaible
I just-- I didn't feel safe.

Daniel Kish
Why?

Lulu Miller
And then what happened is that the kids at school started to mix up Daniel and Adam.

Daniel Kish
People started just lumping us together as the blind kids. We were the same age.

Lulu Miller
You were the blind boys.

Daniel Kish
Yeah. They'd mix up our names, and I didn't like that at all.

Lulu Miller
And so almost to prove his distinction from Adam--

Daniel Kish
I did the things that kids will do in situations like that.

Lulu Miller
What did you do?

Daniel Kish
Um--

Paulette Kish
He made fun of Adam.

Lulu Miller
He started bullying him.

Adam Shaible
I wondered if there was something I had done.

Lulu Miller
He'd tease him in front of other kids--

Daniel Kish
I was pretty brutal.

Lulu Miller
--and even beat him up a few times.

Adam Shaible
Yeah.

Daniel Kish
And that, in my aggressive little mind, was the thing that set me apart.

Adam Shaible
I wanted to be his friend.

Alix Spiegel
So then what happened?

Lulu Miller
Um--

Daniel Kish
Time moved on.

Lulu Miller
Adam and Daniel went to different schools, and Daniel just tried his best to forget this kid so like him, who couldn't get around in the world.

Daniel Kish
And um, we just lost track--

Adam Shaible
We just lost track of each other.

Lulu Miller
Daniel goes off to college, doesn't really associate himself with the blind community. His plan is to become a researcher, an autism researcher. And then one day, he happens to pick up this book.

Bob Scott
The title is The Making of Blind Men.

Daniel Kish
The Making of Blind Men by Robert Scott.

Bob Scott
I go by Bob. You can spell that either way.

Lulu Miller
All right.

This is the book's author, Bob Scott, a former professor of sociology at Princeton. And inside this book was the idea that would change Daniel's life, an idea that when you first hear it sounds kind of out there-- that blindness is a social construction.

Alix Spiegel
Wait, was Bob saying that people are not physically blind?

Lulu Miller
Kind of. But let me just tell you how he gets there.

Alix Spiegel
OK.

Lulu Miller
OK?

Alix Spiegel
OK.

Lulu Miller
So fresh out of grad school, Bob got this job to conduct a huge, multi-year long survey to see how effective blindness organizations were at helping the blind.

Bob Scott
Yep.

Lulu Miller
And so he begins interviewing hundreds of blind people, goes out on hundreds of site visits.

Bob Scott
Basically gathering information in any way I could imagine that I could get it.

Lulu Miller
And then one day, many months into the process, he had--

Bob Scott
What might be called an aha moment.

Lulu Miller
He was out walking in a snowstorm in New York City, when he happened to see--

Bob Scott
A blind beggar--

Lulu Miller
--asking for money--

Bob Scott
--standing on the corner at Bloomingdale's.

Lulu Miller
And he thought, hey, someone else to interview for my survey.

Bob Scott
I said, would you allow me to buy some of your time? And I gave him-- I don't know-- $25 or something like that. We went in and sat down at a restaurant, and I said, tell me your story.

Lulu Miller
Turns out the man had worked at a paint factory until a few years before, when an accident there left him blind. And the people at the factory really liked the guy, so they said, look, why don't you go to an organization for the blind, get some training, and then come back and work for us? So the guy said, great.

He went to an organization for the blind. He said, I've got this job all lined up. Can you just help me with a few basic things. And the blindness organization said no.

Bob Scott
Oh, no. You can't do that. Blind people can't do those things. What we're going to do is put you through a program of rehabilitation and then move you along to our sheltered workshop that manufactures mops and brooms.

Lulu Miller
And Bob said there was one sentence in that response that jumped out at him.

Bob Scott
Blind people can't do those things.

Lulu Miller
And he began to wonder, wait, is that true? Could this guy really not work in a paint factory? Because over the course of his research, he'd seen blind people that could do all sorts of things. And the more that Bob looked around, he started to see that message--

Bob Scott
Blind people can't do those things.

Lulu Miller
--being communicated to the blind people by the blind organizations that serve them-- not necessarily always as explicitly as in the case of the paint guy.

Alix Spiegel
Like, how else then?

Lulu Miller
Well, take the fact that at that time, of the almost 20,000 blind kids that were in America, 2/3 of them were being kept on the sidelines in gym class. Play tag, run around on your own--

Bob Scott
Blind people can't do those things.

Lulu Miller
And then there was the organization's insistence that adult blind people get help getting around.

Bob Scott
They are picked up at their homes. They're driven there. They're met at the sidewalk, walked into the agency, escorted to wherever they're going-- everything is being done for them.

Lulu Miller
And even though all this was intended to help, Bob began to wonder if maybe, just maybe, the organizations' low expectations for what blind people could do was in some way actually limiting the blind people that those organizations sought to help.

Bob Scott
What I came to realize is that how they functioned was a process of learning. It was not imposed on them entirely by the fact that they couldn't see.

Alix Spiegel
Hey, Lulu?

Lulu Miller
Yeah, Alix?

Alix Spiegel
So is Bob saying that blindness is mostly in our head? That blind people can actually do everything that sighted people can do? Because my dad is blind, and he is very, very limited in what he can do. And I gotta say, I don't feel like the obstacles that he faces are obstacles that he wouldn't face if he just thought differently about his blindness.

Lulu Miller
Well, Bob is pretty hardcore about this. I think he would say that with enough time, your dad actually could do a lot more, because he thinks the only real absolute physical limitation of blindness is about an inability to perceive things in the distance.

Bob Scott
Exactly, anything that I can't reach out and touch.

Lulu Miller
But you can compensate for everything else. And Alix?

Alix Spiegel
Uh-huh?

Lulu Miller
Bob wasn't actually the first person to come up with this idea. Blind people were. A group called the National Federation of the Blind has for a long time advocated this kind of idea. This is a group formed by blind people for blind people, and they think that the physical condition of blindness--

Bob Scott
It doesn't explain nearly as much as people believe it explains.

Alix Spiegel
So if you buy this logic, people who are blind-- like, the only thing that's standing between them and walking around the world, like Daniel does, is our beliefs?

Lulu Miller
Yeah. You know, that sounds totally crazy, and that is exactly what he's saying. Which brings us back to Daniel. Daniel reads this book, and he starts thinking about Adam.

Adam Shaible
If I got lost, I used to get terrified.

Lulu Miller
You know, maybe it wasn't that Adam was this weirdo, tentative kid but that he was a very typical product of a system.

Alix Spiegel
You mean, like, the system taught Adam that he would have trouble moving around.

Lulu Miller
Yeah. I mean, he was led around school. People brought him his food--

Adam Shaible
I don't know why people did things for me. They just did.

Lulu Miller
And when Daniel looked at the world around him, he thought, you know, a lot has changed. But a lot is frighteningly similar.

Alix Spiegel
From then till today, things are similar?

Daniel Kish
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
Yeah.

Daniel Kish
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
I called around to over a dozen blindness organizations all over the country.

Daniel Norris
My name is Daniel Norris, supervisor of adult services for the Vermont Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired.

Lulu Miller
And supervisor after supervisor told me that what Bob Scott saw is still very much alive today.

Alix Spiegel
In what way?

Lulu Miller
So most children who are blind in America don't actually go to schools for the blind anymore.

Daniel Norris
Right.

Lulu Miller
Thanks to the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, most blind kids stay in their local public schools, which is great. But on those public school grounds, says Norris--

Daniel Norris
There is a lot of pressure to keep a child safe, especially in a litigious society.

Lulu Miller
So many of the blind students are still placed with a paraeducator, which can be good. But sometimes--

Daniel Norris
Those paraeducators can end up doing the work for the kids.

Lulu Miller
Like Adam.

Daniel Norris
When you lighten someone's load, you don't allow them to expand.

Lulu Miller
I talked to mothers whose blind kids were pulled off of playground equipment. And perhaps the most chilling thing is the fact that most blind kids will intuitively start clicking--

Daniel Kish
[TONGUE CLICKING]

Lulu Miller
--or snapping or stamping to test out their environment with sound. But they are so often discouraged--

Paulette Kish
It's not socially acceptable, is what they would say.

Lulu Miller
--that they never get the chance to develop their skill to the level Daniel did.

Daniel Norris
So how are we doing as a nation? We have not taught independence.

Lulu Miller
He points out that in America, a majority of blind people are unemployed. And while that could be for a lot of reasons, Norris thinks that's on us.

Daniel Kish
What we are doing is we are creating slaves to others' thinking.

Lulu Miller
That's Daniel Kish again.

Daniel Kish
Slaves to others' perception, slaves to what others think they should be doing. And somehow we're comfortable with that.

Lulu Miller
And so, though he had never wanted to work in the profession of blindness-- in fact, he'd wanted to get as far away from it as he could-- Daniel Kish decided he sort of had no choice.

Daniel Kish
It sucked me in kind of kicking and screaming.

Lulu Miller
He could see what was happening. And he held in his tongue, [TONGUE CLICKING], a way out. So he decided that he would dedicate his life to trying to liberate blind children.

Alix Spiegel
Kind of like Batman?

Lulu Miller
Exactamundo, fighting for good in the world in a kind of vigilante way, because actually, the way that you go about liberating a blind child from the constraining forces of culture, it can get kind of ugly.

Ira Glass
Coming up, the Dark Knight rises. Lulu and Alix are back in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio, when our program continues.

Act Two. The Dark Knight Rises.

Ira Glass
It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Today on our program, we have a story from a brand new radio show and podcast called Invisibilia. It's from NPR News. Science reporters Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller are the hosts. And they're here today talking about how profoundly other people's expectations can affect us and about a blind man named Daniel Kish. Anyway, again, here's Alix.

Alix Spiegel
So when last we met Daniel, he had decided that he was going to become a kind of real-life Batman who would save people who were blind from the low expectations of their culture. But before we keep going, I should probably point out that lots of blind people don't necessarily want him as their savior. A bunch of them told us, basically, clicks shmicks!

Bob Ringwald
Because I get along just fine without doing that clicking noise, or whatever he calls it.

Alix Spiegel
This is Bob Ringwald, a musician in California. He says he's got a cane. It works great. He does everything he wants.

Bob Ringwald
When I wanted to learn guitar, I did, and I've done a lot of climbing around on my roof and climbing up poles. And anything I wanted to do, I did.

Alix Spiegel
Now, Bob Ringwald-- in fact, all of the blind people that we spoke to for this story-- agreed with Daniel that low expectations hold blind people back. But that didn't necessarily mean that they wanted to echolocate. For example, when Bob Ringwald was seven, in school for the blind back in the '50s, he knew some kids who clicked and said they just seemed a little weird.

Bob Ringwald
I really didn't want to go through life clicking all the time. A lot of people think blind people are strange. So I didn't want to be any stranger than I already was.

Eric Woods
A lot of instructors don't like people to do that, because it does look funny.

Alix Spiegel
Eric Woods is also blind, and a retired mobility instructor in Colorado.

Eric Woods
And it's socially unacceptable-- not unacceptable, but it's socially different. And so it has been discouraged. I've heard plenty of people discourage it.

Alix Spiegel
And Daniel knew this. He knew what he was up against. So Lulu, what did Daniel do?

Lulu Miller
Well, he starts up a nonprofit, as you do-- a nonprofit that will teach people how to echolocate.

Voice On Video
Grace.

Lulu Miller
This is one of his early instructional videos. It's now 2001, and since his aim is nothing short of liberation, he calls it World Access for the Blind.

Voice On Video
World Access for the Blind.

Lulu Miller
Now, the only little problem that he runs into is that at that time, a blind person teaching another blind person how to get around is basically unheard of.

Daniel Kish
The blind cannot lead the blind is right out of the Bible. It's fundamental to our culture.

Lulu Miller
In fact, until the mid '90s--

Daniel Kish
There was no certification for blind people to train other blind people.

Alix Spiegel
Wow.

Bob Scott
Blind people can't do those things.

Lulu Miller
So this is actually when the bike trick became big-- like, though he sort of hates "Look at the blind man ride a bike," he realized that could get him attention. So he starts going on all these TV shows with his trick.

Daniel Kish
And my segment was between something about vampires and some other thing about faith healing or whatever.

Lulu Miller
And on these TV appearances, he'd try to send some sort of signal to blind kids who might be watching, who might be able to contact him.

[APPLAUSE]

Tv Host
Dan, can anyone learn this?

Daniel Kish
Echolocation is a skill-- piano playing, for example. Some people may be more talented than others, but I think that anyone could learn it.

Lulu Miller
And it worked.

Daniel Kish
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
Slowly but surely, families started contacting him, which meant that Daniel was now faced with a question. Could he actually undo the damage of low expectations? And this is where things begin to get a little morally complicated.

Daniel Kish
The example I'm about to give is an example that took place about 10 years ago.

Lulu Miller
Daniel told me about going out to teach one of his first students ever, a little 10-year-old boy.

Daniel Kish
He lives on an apple orchard--

Lulu Miller
Out in Washington state.

Daniel Kish
I come out. And basically, what I see is a boy who won't leave his house.

Lulu Miller
And so Daniel's idea was to get him to climb a tree.

Daniel Kish
They live on an orchard full of trees, for goodness' sakes.

Lulu Miller
But the kid won't budge. So to get him out the door, Daniel takes away all his toys.

Daniel Kish
Our purpose was to kind of simulate the world that he was choosing for himself. So this is what life will have in store for you-- basically nothing, OK? Nothing.

Lulu Miller
And after about a week, the kid finally agrees to go climb a frickin' tree. And he gets up onto the first branch and the second branch and then says, OK.

Daniel Kish
I give up. I give up. Yeah, but you know what? Giving up isn't an option. You can decide never to climb a tree for the rest of your life, but we are going to climb this one. And I said, you can go up, you cannot go down. And he just had a fit-- literally screaming himself hoarse. I mean, he actually jumped at one point. Like, he actually leapt off the tree, he was in such a frenzy.

Alix Spiegel
Oh my god, Lulu. And what does Daniel do?

Lulu Miller
Well, he catches him. He's right below him. And he just says, no.

Daniel Kish
You can go up. You cannot go down.

Lulu Miller
And they stay in this tree battling it out.

Daniel Kish
Inch by inch by-- it took three hours to get up a 60-foot tree.

Lulu Miller
But by the end, the kid was doing it himself.

Daniel Kish
--doing it himself. He started finding his own footholds, finding his own handholds.

Lulu Miller
And Daniel thinks this training and how the parents then took it on too changed the boy's life.

Daniel Kish
By the age of 13, he was out of his shell. He had joined Boy Scouts. That is in no way where he was headed.

Alix Spiegel
Hm. That is just crazy, though, that story, on some level. I don't know if that kind of bullying is even allowed in America anymore, you know?

Lulu Miller
Yeah. And most schools for the blind have been reluctant to hire him because of liability issues. They're scared it'll be too dangerous for their students.

Alix Spiegel
I bet.

Lulu Miller
But see, Daniel would say that attitude, Alix, is part of the problem. So what are a few tears, huh, a few scratches? He has this line he always says.

Daniel Kish
Running into a pole is a drag. But never being allowed to run into a pole is a disaster.

Lulu Miller
He worries that when you prevent a kid from, say, running into a pole, what you end up preventing them from is the kind of experience that allow for-- and this gets me back to that crazy sounding claim he made at the beginning of the show-- actual sight.

Daniel Kish
If our culture recognized the capacity of blind people to see, then more blind people would learn to see. It's actually pretty simple and straightforward.

Lulu Miller
Daniel thinks this because, well, he says he sees.

Daniel Kish
I definitely would say that I experience images, that I have images.

Lulu Miller
And he isn't talking metaphorically here.

Daniel Kish
They are images of spatial character and depth that have a lot of the same qualities that a person who sees would see.

Lore Thaler
Hello?

Lulu Miller
Hi.

Lore Thaler
Hi.

Lulu Miller
This is Lore Thaler, a German neuroscientist at Durham University in the UK. And Lore knows a lot about sight. She studies vision in the brain-- literally how the images we see are constructed.

Lore Thaler
It sounds simple, but an image is actually a complex construct.

Lulu Miller
Several years ago, Lore happened across a video of Daniel.

Daniel Kish
OK, so we had a little string of parked vehicles there--

Lulu Miller
And as she watched the way that he so easily moved through space, she found herself wondering, was there any way that Daniel's brain was indeed constructing images?

Lore Thaler
It was so akin to vision, really.

Lulu Miller
OK, so you may know this already, but Lore reminded me that an image, even though it feels like it's out there in the world in front of your eyes actually exists behind the eyes.

Lore Thaler
The image, it's something that your mind constructs.

Lulu Miller
In a part of your brain called the visual cortex. So Lore brought Daniel and a few other people who can echolocate into her lab, and she took recordings of them while they clicked at different objects in space.

Daniel Kish
[TONGUE CLICKING]

Lulu Miller
A car, a lamppost-- these are her actual recordings-- a salad bowl, a salad bowl in motion.

Alix Spiegel
How do you get a salad bowl in motion?

Lulu Miller
You stand behind the person with a salad bowl on a fishing pole, and you slowly wave it.

Alix Spiegel
Right.

Lulu Miller
And the microphones were actually in their ears.

Lore Thaler
So we recorded what they heard exactly.

Alix Spiegel
Oh, that's neat.

Lulu Miller
And then she played the recordings back to them, one object at a time, while they were lying down in fMRI machines, so she could watch how their brains responded. [TONGUE CLICKING] Salad bowl. [TONGUE CLICKING] Salad bowl in motion.

And then in a second study, she compared those readings to what happens in the brains of sighted people looking at the same kinds of things. Salad bowl. Salad bowl in motion.

Alix Spiegel
Very clever, very clever.

Lulu Miller
Yep. And what she found is that even though for decades scientists assumed that the visual cortex goes dark when you are blind, Daniel's was lighting up like a disco ball.

Lore Thaler
Yeah, so that was really very impressive.

Lulu Miller
And the way in which it was lighting up-- this is really cool. So it turns out that there are all these different parts of the brain involved in vision. So there's an area that's specifically dedicated to processing motion, and that's way over here behind the ears. And then there's a completely different area for texture--

Lore Thaler
Lightness, so how bright is something.

Lulu Miller
--orientation, shape. And in Daniel's brain, many of these areas were lighting up. Color and brightness, no action there. But motion, when they did that salad bowl in motion test, the motion area behind the ears started pumping with blood flow.

Lore Thaler
Very vigorously.

Lulu Miller
And orientation-- turns out there's sort of a grid for orientation in the brain. And she could watch as the salad bowl moved across those quadrants.

Lore Thaler
It was really robust, highly significant.

Lulu Miller
All right, Miss Spiegel. So I know that sometimes neurology and neuroscience--

Alix Spiegel
Goes over my head?

Lulu Miller
Or just sounds like a foreign language that you're not particularly interested in speaking.

Alix Spiegel
Uh-huh. Just land the plane for me. What does this mean?

Lulu Miller
What this work suggests is that you may not actually need eyes to see.

Lulu Miller
I kind of feel like we've got to shout it from the rooftops. Come on.

Alix Spiegel
Oh my god.

Lulu Miller
OK. You might not need eyes to see!

Now, Lore is by no means the only person seeing this result. The idea first started coming up in the mid '90s, when a lab at Harvard saw that visual areas of the brain can be activated by sound and touch.

Alix Spiegel
Do I have to do it?

Lulu Miller
Uh-huh.

Alix Spiegel
You might not need eyes to see!

Lulu Miller
And since then, dozens of labs have been looking into just how nuanced and rich that visual imagery may be. So there's a guy at Berkeley, Santani Teng, who's been trying to determine the acuity of these images. You know, like an eye test-- how close to 20/20 are they?

Alix Spiegel
Uh-huh.

Lulu Miller
And what he's found is that their 75% localization thresholds indicated spatial acuity as fine as 1.5 degrees of the subtended angle.

Alix Spiegel
No!

Lulu Miller
It's true! I'll put it another way. He thinks their world looks a lot like your peripheral vision. So imagine that you're texting on your cellphone walking down the street. OK, you're looking at that screen. Now, what does the street look like to you?

You know, you can see people coming at you. You can see cars. You can see trees. But you couldn't read a sign. That, he thinks, is Daniel's world.

Daniel Kish
I can honestly, honestly say that I do not feel blind.

Alix Spiegel
So what does Lore say about this? Does she think that the echolocators are actually seeing?

Lulu Miller
Well--

Lore Thaler
That's almost philosophical, isn't it?

Lulu Miller
Lore asks the only people on Earth who can know-- people who use to see. You know, is what they're experiencing comparable?

Brian Bushway
Yeah, oh yeah.

Lulu Miller
This is Brian Bushway, who you met briefly at the top of the show.

Brian Bushway
So step right up!

I became totally blind at the age of 14.

Lulu Miller
But once he learned echolocation--

Brian Bushway
Just [SNAP] like that!

Lulu Miller
--the world around him, although blurrier and colorless, appeared again.

Brian Bushway
Things are real. I mean, it's as real as looking at it.

Alix Spiegel
Wait, wait, wait. So Lulu, does every blind person have this?

Lulu Miller
No. And that's the thing-- Lore has looked at the brains of people who do not echolocate, and though there's definitely some activity in the visual cortex, it's simply not as active. Which brings me back to Daniel's teaching methods. The thing about echolocation is, yes, you can learn it when you get older. But it gets so much harder with age, which is why Daniel doesn't give a damn about making a little kid cry, because he thinks at the other end of those tears is sight.

Daniel Kish
OK, off we go.

Lulu Miller
So I finally got to see one of these training sessions in action. We went to see a five-year-old boy named Nathan Nip.

Daniel Kish
OK, so what we'll do then is we'll ask Nathan's mom about parks or some place that he doesn't know.

Lulu Miller
Brian's with us too, actually. He's now one of Daniel's deputy teachers.

Daniel Kish
He can click.

Lulu Miller
And part of the goal that day was to get Nathan out of his comfort zone. But the bigger part-- and really, what is often this other major part of what Daniel is trying to teach-- is to get the people around Nathan to back off.

Daniel Kish
Hello?

Godmother
Hi!

Lulu Miller
So we go into the house.

Nathan Nip
I am five and a half, and Ashton's two.

Lulu Miller
Daniel asks to hear Nathan's clicks.

Nathan Nip
[TONGUE CLICKING]

Daniel Kish
You have a nice smiley click.

Lulu Miller
And then we head out to a faraway park.

Brian Bushway
Where are we? Where do you think we are?

Nathan Nip
At the field!

Brian Bushway
At the field.

Lulu Miller
Ding, ding, ding. It's a sports field flanked by a really busy road.

Brian Bushway
Nathan? Nathan?

Lulu Miller
And the idea is to make Nathan find his way around this park by himself.

Brian Bushway
So we want to use our, [TONGUE CLICKING], our clicks. And we're going to explore what's around here in this park. Let's see if we can find anything, OK?

Nathan Nip
Yeah.

Brian Bushway
OK.

Lulu Miller
So he finds a soccer net.

Brian Bushway
Yeah.

Lulu Miller
He tries to find a fence at one side of the park--

Brian Bushway
Well, you're-- yeah, we're in the bushes.

Lulu Miller
--but gets a little turned around.

Brian Bushway
Come back toward me. Nathan, come back toward me.

Lulu Miller
And then it's time to find the edge of the road.

Brian Bushway
What noises do we hear right now?

Nathan Nip
Cars?

Brian Bushway
Cars.

Lulu Miller
So Brian tells Nathan to walk toward those cars.

Brian Bushway
And we'll all follow behind you.

Lulu Miller
At this point, it's just me and the godmother and Brian.

Nathan Nip
Where's Ashton?

Brian Bushway
He's over there.

Lulu Miller
Everyone else is on the other side of the park.

Nathan Nip
Can we please go to him?

Brian Bushway
No.

Nathan Nip
Why?

Lulu Miller
Nathan is leading.

Brian Bushway
Can I hear you click?

Nathan Nip
[TONGUE CLICKING].

Lulu Miller
And picture this-- I mean, this is, like, a little five-year-old boy with a tiny white cane--

Alix Spiegel
Kind of tapping his way towards oncoming traffic?

Lulu Miller
Tapping his way toward oncoming traffic, which is a jarring sight. And the person closest to him is Brian, who is also blind.

Brian Bushway
Listen out in front of you. Listen into the distance.

Lulu Miller
And he's getting closer and closer to the edge of the road. Four feet, three feet, and then--

[CAR APPROACHING]

[SILENCE]

--his godmother just shoots out and grabs him back. And Brian kind of noticeably flinched.

Brian Bushway
Let's try to stay, like, more or less behind him.

Lulu Miller
Because while he completely understands why the godmother would reach out for Nathan, he said it is precisely that kind of moment that does the damage.

Brian Bushway
Often sighted people will jump in a half a second too soon, and they rob the blind student from that learning moment. And that just keeps happening over and over again, and I think so many blind people's lives, they never get that moment of what it is to really have that self-confidence to trust your senses to know, oh, if I do use my cane properly and I am listening attentively to information around me, I'll be OK.

Lulu Miller
I think part of the problem is that when we have eyes, we can see things coming from further away. The whole point is, like, when it's your cane and you're clicking, you catch edges at what appears like the last moment.

Brian Bushway
We don't need to go any farther. Why? Why don't we need to go any further?

Nathan Nip
'Cause there's cars.

Brian Bushway
Yeah, so it means the street's here.

Nathan Nip
[TONGUE CLICKING].

Alix Spiegel
Can I ask you a question?

Lulu Miller
Mm-hmm.

Alix Spiegel
What if you're a half-second too late?

Lulu Miller
Right.

Alix Spiegel
Because I think that probably a lot of parents-- I mean, the thing that keeps them reaching out well before the half-second before is kind of the specter of the half-second after.

Lulu Miller
So I think you grabbed him there.

Godmother
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lulu Miller
And what was that moment like?

Well, this is exactly what Nathan's godmother brought up.

Godmother
It is hard.

Lulu Miller
She understands the dangers of a half-second too early.

Godmother
He has to learn how to make that judgment.

Lulu Miller
But at the end of the day, she is far more concerned about the dangers of the half-second too late.

Godmother
You don't really want to risk that.

Lulu Miller
Which brings me to possibly the biggest thing that Daniel is up against in his quest to change expectations-- love.

Daniel Norris
You can't blame mom and dad for struggling and wanting to keep their child safe.

Lulu Miller
This is Dan Norris again from the blindness organization in Vermont. And when we asked him if a change like the one Daniel's hoping for, a massive change in expectations, could actually take place, one of the main obstacles he brought up was love.

Daniel Norris
It's very hard as a parent with a child who's visually impaired to let go.

Lulu Miller
Even when the expectations for that kid are high, he said love can get in the way.

Daniel Norris
Those parents, they want to keep their child safe. They want their child to not suffer. And that's very noble but holds the kids back.

Lulu Miller
So in 10 years in the field, how many kids on bikes have you seen, blind kids on bikes?

Daniel Kish
Blind kids on bikes? I have seen about five.

Lulu Miller
That's actually pretty good.

Daniel Kish
Yeah, I think that we are seeing society begin to change.

Lulu Miller
But when he thinks about the sheer volume of love, brimming in every household on every schoolyard and every street corner--

Daniel Kish
Are we going to get there any time soon as a nation? Um, no. I don't think so.

Lulu Miller
And this gets us finally to what may have been Daniel's one true superpower.

Daniel Kish
What most people find to be the meaning of life absolutely creeps me out.

Lulu Miller
Daniel is 49 and has never been with a partner. And he finds the whole idea of physical intimacy--

Daniel Kish
Unsettling.

Lulu Miller
We had finally reached the end of our hike, the place Daniel wanted to take me.

Daniel Kish
Is this, like, awesome?

Lulu Miller
Yeah.

It was a huge old oak tree, miles from civilization, that Daniel said was one of his favorite spots on Earth.

Daniel Kish
OK.

Lulu Miller
And so we climbed up it together.

Daniel Kish
Let's see where I would go.

Lulu Miller
20 feet, 30 feet, maybe 40 feet.

Lulu Miller
You're very high!

And it was there in the branches that he told me he's never really been one for love.

Daniel Kish
I was never that interested in closeness as a kid. I wasn't really a lap-sitter. I didn't like holding hands. I didn't really like hugs.

Lulu Miller
He even used to have nightmares about it.

Daniel Kish
A child's mind will turn things into very ghoulish, ghastly, deeply unsettling, spooky things.

Lulu Miller
Like what? Like, what would be a nightmare about--

Daniel Kish
There were two.

Lulu Miller
In one, a hand chased after him.

Daniel Kish
And then the other thing were the plastic arms that want to sort engulf and unfold and just kind of take you in to themselves.

Lulu Miller
He's not sure where this comes from. He wonders if it could have been the surgeries he had as a tiny boy or from the way his parents raised him. Or maybe he just always was that way.

Daniel Kish
Who knows?

Lulu Miller
And while he's not suggesting that you need this quality to become independent, when he looks back, he wonders if this may have been one of the things that protected him from the debilitating effects of low expectations. Because unlike the rest of us, when those arms reached out for him, he never once had any desire to fall back into them.

Paulette Kish
Everything that happens in your life has its effect.

Lulu Miller
That's his mom again, Paulette.

Paulette Kish
Has its effect.

Lulu Miller
And you don't think it's that Daniel became this way because he was in some way neglected or because it was too hard? Is there any part of you that thinks you went too far in terms of letting him be?

Paulette Kish
No. No. He's happy.

Daniel Kish
Totally happy.

Lulu Miller
We sat there for a while, watching the afternoon slip away.

Daniel Kish
Listen to how quiet it is.

Lulu Miller
And suddenly I got that pang you get when you realize it's getting dark, and you are far, far from civilization. And that was followed by another pang that it literally didn't matter, because he'd be the one leading us out.

Daniel Kish
[TONGUE CLICKING] That's amazing.

Lulu Miller
Yeah.

Daniel Kish
[TONGUE CLICKING]

He says, sure, yes, it's true. He was found wearing a bathing suit standing out in the middle of the street in the middle of winter, in the middle of night, holding a quarter million dollars in cash that was not his.

Paulette Kish
But that could happen to anyone. It can happen to anyone.

Ira Glass
I'm Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories of This American Life.

Ira Glass
OK, real estate shoppers-- some important factors to take into account when you're choosing a neighborhood-- price, how long your commute will be, schools, safety, does Mos Def live nearby? That last one was a factor for Adam when he was looking at this one neighborhood in New York.

Adam
The fact that Mos Def allegedly lived there. I think at the time, he and Erykah Badu might have been together. I did run into Mos Def at the overpriced bodega on the corner and did the creepy thing of, like, seeing him through the window, waiting for him outside, and accosting him the second he came outside and being like, "yo, man. Your album was really significant to me." And he looked terrified. You know, he couldn't wait to get out of there with, like, his $12 mangoes or whatever.

Ira Glass
This was a Brooklyn neighborhood called Fort Greene. It was the year 2000, and the neighborhood was in the early stages of gentrifying. Adam left his cell number with a bunch of real estate brokers.

Adam
And Fort Greene was very real estate broker intensive. You know, it's not a big neighborhood. There were possibly more brokers than there were blocks. So I left my phone number with a bunch of these brokers. And I was walking up Fulton Street probably an hour after dropping all these phone numbers off when I got a call from one of these brokers.

And she was a British lady. And she started describing to me an apartment. And it had high ceilings and wood floors and lots of natural light. And it sounded great. But the only problem was the apartment was not in Forte Greene. It was in Bed-Stuy, Bedford-Stuyvesant.

Ira Glass
Bed-Stuy-- further from Manhattan, more crime, less gentrified. For instance, Adam says if you visited both neighborhoods, Fort Greene and Bed-Stuy, and compared what the fake businesses were like that marijuana dealers worked out of--

Adam
Like how plausible are they as businesses? You know? So if it's the kind of thing where you walk into a bodega and there's, like, one can of grape soda and a box of baking powder and a shady looking dude behind six inches of reinforced bulletproof glass, then your neighborhood is far from gentrified. Whereas Fort Greene at that point had businesses which I went to because I wanted to actually partake of their legal goods and services and didn't even know that they were weed spots. Like there was this hat shop that I actually bought a hat at. And everybody looked at me like, you knot that's not really a hat shop, right? So that was the level that Fort Greene was at.

Ira Glass
OK. So transitional.

Adam
Yes, transitional.

Ira Glass
But less transitional than Bed-Stuy. So he bought records in Bed-Stuy, he ate dinner in Bed-Stuy, and, as he told the real estate broker, did not want to live in Bed-Stuy.

Adam
And so I said, "you know, the apartment sounds cool. But I'm going to pass. Bed-Stuy's a little bit Boondocksickle for me. So call me if you get a Fort Greene listing." And very quickly and professionally, she switched gears and started trying to convince me that I should check out the Bed-Stuy apartment.

So she said, look, "I don't know what you've heard about Bed-Stuy. But it's really very nice. It's very safe. It's changing very fast. A lot of white people are moving there." And I stopped dead in my tracks, offended and surprised that after about 10 seconds on the phone with me, this woman wanted to have this kind of conspiratorial nudge-nudge-wink-wink conversation as a way of letting me know that Bed-Stuy was safe for people like me. I was mostly offended by it.

So I figured that I should end that line of conversation as forcefully as possible and kind of shock her back. So I said, I don't like white people that much, and I'm not trying to live around too many of them. And there was, like, silence on the phone. And then she said something along the lines of, "you-- you don't like white people?"

And I was like, "no. You know, I don't hate them or anything. But they walk around like they own the planet. They're really entitled. They don't make particularly good neighbors. So no, I'm not really trying to live around too many of them."

And there was more silence on the phone. And then very slowly and deliberately she said, "sir, I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. I can tell from your voice that you're obviously African American."

And I cut her off. And I was like, "no, no, no. You got it wrong. I'm white."

And then I add something like, "no offense. She says, oh, I'm not offended. I get it. I'm black," which, because of her British accent, hadn't occurred to me.

And the next thing I remember about the conversation is basically that the two of us both start laughing because in the space of about a minute we had both made so many assumptions and cycled through so many identities. The absurdity of it just, I think, hit us both at once.

Noreen Sumpter
I assumed that he was black.

Ira Glass
Well, does he sound black to you in this recording?

Noreen Sumpter
Yes, he does. And it's just-- I realize it's the way he spreads his words out for me.

Ira Glass
After talking to Adam, I got in touch with the real estate broker, Noreen Sumpter. And she remembers this incident the same way he does with one exception. She says she would not have said, "I'm sorry. I did not mean to offend you. Are you African American?"

Noreen Sumpter
No, I didn't say that. I just directly-- "oh, so you black." Do I sound like I'd be, (AMERICAN ACCENT) "sir, are you sorry? I'm sorry." (DROPS ACCENT) No, I'm not that. I'm like, "oh, really? You don't like white people? Are you black?"

Ira Glass
She's no longer in real estate these days. She's a life coach. But she says the thing that set Adam off-- the race-baiting, wink, wink, don't-worry-a-lot-of-white-people-are-moving-there-- was not something she said to white clients or to anybody else. She only said it to him because--

Noreen Sumpter
I assumed that he was black and he was scared to move into a black neighborhood with black people is why I said it to him. Right? Like, what is this guy? You're a black guy. What are you-- so that's why I said, there's a lot of white people moving there, meaning that you're black. If you're a black man, you should be comfortable in that neighborhood.

Ira Glass
Like white people aren't scared to live there. Why can't you?

Noreen Sumpter
Yeah. Like what's going on? What's over there with you why you wouldn't move there? But he wasn't a black man. He was a white guy.

Ira Glass
I love the efficiency of this story. Like, I like how we all have people in our lives who it takes years to figure, like, oh, I totally misjudged this person. And this is the most efficient version of getting somebody wrong and realizing you've gotten it wrong. Like, you couldn't do it in fewer sentences.

Noreen Sumpter
Look, I'm the queen of the world. You know what? The people in my building call me Queen Nor, Goddess of the Universe. So that makes me realize that I can solve anything. Anything can be solved through a conversation. I did assume, and he assumed, and we both assumed back and forth. But we resolved it in, like, a heartbeat. So, hey, kudos for us.

Ira Glass
Sometimes people's answers to questions really surprise me. Well, today on our program, people who are in this same situation, where they realize, oh, no. I thought you were one thing, and I got it wrong. You are not that person. Except in these other cases, they do not have Queen Nor to help them wrap it up so quickly. And so some of these misunderstandings and misperceptions, they drag on for years, with a lot more feelings attached to them.

From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.

Act One. Who Really Is On Line 1?

Ira Glass
Act One, "Who's Really On Line Two?" And now, a radio host discovering things about his listeners that he wishes were not true, obviously one of the worst things that could ever happen to a person. I think we can all agree on that. I'm saying this as if this is a problem in my life. I don't-- it's not at all.

Anyway, it recently happened to Tony Beam, host of the radio show Christian Worldview Today in South Carolina. Zoe Chace tells the story.

Zoe Chace
Tony's on early mornings, 92.9 FM, 660 AM, weekdays. His show is for and by the evangelical community. Politics, news, a little sports, God-- that's his show.

Tony Beam
"All right, welcome back. Hour number two of Christian Worldview Today is coming off the shelf, and it's coming straight at you. But just receive it. It's a good thing."

Zoe Chace
Tony and his callers speak the same language. They hate Obamacare, deficit spending. They feel the Christian right gets no respect from the Republican establishment. And when Tony endorses a presidential candidate, enough of his listeners agree with him that candidates seek him out. They come on the air with him. He went with Huckabee in '08, Santorum in 2012.

Last spring, Ted Cruz invited Tony and his wife up to DC. He sat them down in a private Washington apartment and made a pitch. He was going to unite the Tea Party, the libertarians, the evangelicals, and win. Tony told me how much he liked him.

Tony Beam
Not only did he have the principles and convictions that I have, but he had a political strategy that I thought would succeed. And when we walked out of that meeting, my wife, who is not near as involved in politics or fascinated by as I am, she looked at me and she says, you do what you want. I'm voting for that guy.

Zoe Chace
Not long after, he went on the radio and endorsed Cruz, a lifelong evangelical conservative.

Tony Beam
"I believe he's the right man for the job. I believe he's the right person that's got insider knowledge. But he's an outsider within his own party because he's willing to call out his party. That impresses me."

Zoe Chace
Tony knows this scene-- anti-establishment Christian Republicans in South Carolina. Year after year, he goes to the state political gatherings, the Silver Elephant dinner, Jeff Duncan's Faith in Freedom BBQ. He grew up listening to Ronald Reagan on the radio, sitting in the kitchen with his dad.

Tony Beam
And he was telling me, you know, this guy has got the answer for the future.

Zoe Chace
That is a real American Republican origin story.

Tony Beam
It is. It really is.

Zoe Chace
You and your dad in the kitchen, the eggs frying, listening to Ronald Reagan on the radio.

Tony Beam
I can hear it. And I can actually, I can smell the-- I mean, most people it was bacon and eggs. My dad loved livermush, believe it or not. And he would fry livermush and make like livermush and egg sandwiches.

Zoe Chace
Tony was especially excited this election year. As the establishment candidates, Bush and Scott Walker, flamed out, his guy Ted Cruz was on the rise. It looked like he had a real shot at being the nominee. Obviously, there is also this other candidate in the race-- Donald Trump. But Tony wasn't worried about Trump. He figured Trump does not fit in with people built on livermush and the Bible.

Tony Beam
When Donald Trump got in the race, I said, pssh. In three weeks, we'll be done here because there's no way that people are going to go chasing after him.

Zoe Chace
Then came the first Republican debate, the one where Megyn Kelly, the Fox News anchor, asked Trump about some stuff he'd said about women. And unlike this week, Trump was there to answer those questions.

Megyn Kelly
"You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals. Your Twitter account--"

Donald Trump
"Only Rosie O'Donnell."

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

Megyn Kelly
"No, it wasn't."

Zoe Chace
I'll point out over this 16 seconds of cheering and applause that this turned out to be a very controversial line of questioning.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

OK, still going.

Donald Trump
"Thank you."

Megyn Kelly
"For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell."

Donald Trump
"Yes, I'm sure it was."

Megyn Kelly
"Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks. You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?"

Tony Beam
I thought it was fair game. I mean, this is-- Democrats do pound Republicans with a war on women. And now we've got a guy who's kind of the front-runner who's attacking the way a woman looks and attacking other women by name? Are you kidding me?

Donald Trump
"And frankly, what I say-- and oftentimes, it's fun. It's kidding. We have a good time. What I say is what I say."

Tony Beam
I come and crack the microphone after that first debate. And I'm like, [GIGGLING] Trump's done. This is it. He's really stepped in it now. And I'm plastered with people calling me telling me how glad they are the way Trump handled himself and that he won that debate. And I was stunned. I thought I was doing somebody else's talk show, that they had switched frequencies on me and not told me, and that I was actually doing a show from a different location. This is crazy. This is not who we are.

Zoe Chace
And that was just the beginning.

Radio Caller
"And I've been waiting for years to hear a politician that talks the way Donald Trump talks. Now is he going to deliver? I don't know. But I'm telling you, I'm a Trumpeter. I mean, unless he's a liar, he's saying all the right things."

Tony Beam
"Yeah."

Radio Caller
"And whether his conservative credentials are bona fide or not, that's not the point. See, anybody can change. Ronald Reagan did, as we all know."

Tony Beam
"Alex, Alex. I hate to interrupt a great rant, and that was a great rant. And as far as rants goes, that was right up there. But you said it doesn't-- I don't know if his conservative credentials are true or not. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't?"

Zoe Chace
Calls like these got under Tony's skin real quick.

Radio Caller
"Donald Trump made a statement a couple of weeks ago that he wants to pursue the families of the--"

Tony Beam
"Yes, yes."

Radio Caller
"--of these jihadists."

Tony Beam
"Yeah, wants to kill them."

Radio Caller
"And it was sixth-grade outrage. And I can give you examples of two presidents who actually did that. One was the third president of the United States. And the other was the 39th president of the United States."

Tony Beam
"OK. So you think that's a good idea?"

Radio Caller
"And by the way, so did Harry Truman when he dropped the atom bombs."

Tony Beam
"You think it's a good idea? You think it's a good idea. I'm not asking you-- no."

Radio Caller
"I didn't say it was a good idea, Tony."

Tony Beam
"Put a stake in the ground, Gene."

Radio Caller
"But this is warfare. This is what happens."

Tony Beam
"If you're gonna call and do this, put a stake in the ground. I'm asking you. I'm calling you out. I'm calling you out. Do you want to ban all Muslims from the United States, and do you want to kill all the family members of anybody who's ever been involved in terrorism? Is that what you want? Is that what you want?"

Radio Caller
"I want--"

Tony Beam
"No, no no!"

Zoe Chace
Tony's a pastor, a doctor of ministry from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. And his big problem with Trump is that he's not a good Christian. He doesn't share the values that govern Tony's entire life.

For instance, last summer, an interviewer asked Trump if he'd ever asked God for forgiveness of his sins. And Trump was like, "why should I? I don't make mistakes. I mean, I drink the wine. I eat the cracker." Some people thought it was funny. Tony did not.

Given that, nothing drives him crazier than when his listeners try to defend Trump along biblical lines, like when that guy Gene calls in to talk about Trump and the Second Book of Kings.

Radio Caller
"When I sit here and listen to Trump, I agree with a lot of what he's saying. And I want to remind your audience of a person in the Bible."

Tony Beam
"Oh, my gosh."

Radio Caller
"Who took down Jezebel? What was the name--"

Zoe Chace
OK, what Gene is talking about is in the Second Book of Kings, this guy Jehu murdered Queen Jezebel because she had pagan idols around the kingdom. Then he threw her body to the dogs. Jehu was like a warrior against a corrupt culture.

Radio Caller
"His name was Jehu. Do you remember that?"

Tony Beam
"I remember. And you think--"

Radio Caller
"The Book of Kings."

Tony Beam
"--Donald Trump is Jehu?"

Radio Caller
"Yes. Yes."

Tony Beam
"You do?"

Radio Caller
"Yes. Remember, Jehu was not a righteous man in God's eyes. And God used Jehu to fulfill Elijah's prophecy regarding Jezebel."

Tony Beam
"But you believe that God-- yeah, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Gene. We have such chaos in this country that we would look to a man like Donald Trump, who has no core value system, to lead us back to the place that we need to be as a country."

Radio Caller
"I think Trump is gonna realize that he may well have to work with the Congress--"

Zoe Chace
In a recent poll of South Carolina evangelical voters, Trump is leading, eight points ahead of Ted Cruz. Nationally, he's ahead by more than 15% with evangelical voters. Tony is in this very real struggle that I'd say a lot of anti-establishment Republicans are in. There is a part of the Donald Trump thing that appeals to him. Take this moment from the South Carolina Republican debate.

Donald Trump
"And I can say, oh, I'm not angry. I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly. And I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we're gonna repeal it--"

Tony Beam
I got to admit, when I hear stuff like that, I'm like, "yeah! Go! Just yeah, hit him again, harder!" And then I step back and go, wait a minute.

Zoe Chace
Do I really want him to be president?

Tony Beam
This is insane because the emotional part of me cannot take control over the thought process that is going to be what carries us in the long run. And that's what scares me about this whole thing. All of this is being wrought out on pure emotion. It's just been building.

Obama is getting his way. Nobody's standing against him. He's ruining this country. He doesn't love America. And we don't have people that are pushing back. And it just-- that mindset turns, and people get madder and madder. And I'm afraid we're gonna split the party and be in real trouble.

Zoe Chace
Do you have a specific memory of somebody calling in the show, and you think, oh, wait a minute. This isn't going away.

Tony Beam
Yeah, Barry. Yeah. He called. He calls my show a lot. And I call him the Trump interpreter.

"All right. Barry's on the phone. Hello, Barry."

Barry Chisholm
"Hey, Tony. I got a couple questions on the Donald for you."

Tony Beam
"OK, sure. Go ahead."

Barry is an evangelical Christian. He's very strong in his faith. And when he called and was all about Trump, I was like, oh, my gosh.

Barry Chisholm
"Now, the pushback that's he's doing against the media, various different reporters, and so forth-- good or bad?"

Tony Beam
"It's good and bad."

Barry Chisholm
"Donald Trump is burying--"

Tony Beam
"Bullying."

Barry Chisholm
"--the GOP establishment."

Tony Beam
"Oh. Hm."

Barry Chisholm
"Is that a good or bad thing?"

Tony Beam
"Well, I think it's a good thing for his campaign. And I think it's a good thing for the people who are tired of the GOP establishment going to Washington and doing squat to make changes."

Barry Chisholm
"Sounds like you're on the Trump train."

Tony Beam
"No. I'm not on the Trump train."

Barry Chisholm
"Then what's going on?"

Tony Beam
"I didn't say that he's not doing things that are helpful."

Barry Chisholm
"I know. I know."

Tony Beam
"And I'm saying-- look, what I'm saying is, I don't want to get into all the reasons why I think it's a problem. But anyway, Barry, thanks. We don't have time. We got to take a break. We'll come back. We've got a couple of guests in the studios we want to--"

Zoe Chace
Notice how much Tony and Barry agree on. The media is unfair to their candidates. The Republican establishment dismisses them. But still--

Zoe Chace
So you've gotten to know Barry.

Tony Beam
Well, I wouldn't recognize him if he walked in the room. But I've talked to him enough on the air where, over the years-- I mean, he's been calling this show for years. And I felt like I knew him pretty well. But he's gone in a direction that I would have said wouldn't have happened.

I thought we agreed that the person that we wanted to lead us would agree with our principles and have that at their core. So you're willing to lay all that aside? Oh, I think he has those principles whether he's a Christian or not. I just raise the white flag and go, line two because I don't know what to do about that.

Zoe Chace
So after months of squabbling with Barry and the other callers over Trump, Tony remembers vividly the moment he was sure the ongoing argument with his listeners would finally end. It was the moment he was sure Trump had lost the evangelical vote. It was when Trump said we needed to ban all Muslims from coming to America.

Tony Beam
My first thought was, no. That-- no. Somebody's got that messed up. So then I find a video where he actually makes that statement.

Donald Trump
Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.

Tony Beam
And I was horrified. You want to know my initial reaction? I was horrified. I'm thinking to myself, this is so opposed to everything that are my core values.

Zoe Chace
Were you nervous to come in and do the show after that happened because you knew--

Tony Beam
No, because I'm an idiot. Because I came in and thought, man, this may help Trump overall. But Christians, they're going to be appalled by this.

Zoe Chace
Barry's on the line. Go ahead, Barry.

Barry Chisholm
He didn't say their religious expression. He said Muslims, which--

Tony Beam
It's a religion!

Barry Chisholm
Their ideology is absolutely a conquering ideology. But--

Zoe Chace
He's saying Muslims have a conquering ideology.

Barry Chisholm
--until we can find out what's going on. So, you know--

Tony Beam
OK. Well, why don't we ban Christians? Why don't we-- you know, Christians have in their background an ideological conquering mentality. I mean, you look at that Old Testament, man, you've got the Jews that were taking over the entire country. Christianity rose out of Judaism in the Christian-- now, I'm talking. I'm talking now, Barry. See, this is the way this works. We don't talk at the same time.

So we need to be-- what I'm trying to get you to see is that once we start down a road where we tell people that because of their religious expression, we're going to deny them entry into the country, we're setting a precedent.

Barry Chisholm
Yeah, I disagree because that's not what he's saying. It's their ideology. It's the connection with terror is what he's talking about.

Tony Beam
But all Muslims are not terrorist. All Muslims are not terrorist. All Christians don't shoot abortion doctors and bomb abortion clinics. I don't want to get lumped in with them because I'm a Christian any more than there are Muslims that don't want to be lumped into the idea of terrorism because there are radical Islamic extremists who are trying to kill people. Barry, thanks for the call.

Robbie, I'm gonna have to hold you. We got to take a break. We'll come back. We'll talk to Robbie.

Zoe Chace
So I went to Barry, in person, to understand, yes, why he loves Trump so much, but really, how he'd strayed so far from Tony.

Zoe Chace
Is it you?

Barry Chisholm
Hello, there. How are you?

Zoe Chace
Hi, Barry.

Barry Chisholm
This is my son, David.

Zoe Chace
I'm Zoe. It's just, I'm thrilled to meet you. You're like a celebrity to me.

Barry Chisholm
Oh, really? I don't understand. How's that? I don't get it.

Zoe Chace
Barry Chisholm, in the flesh. He works 20 minutes away from Tony's radio studio. He runs a small business managing employee benefits. This means he is up close and personal with Obamacare, which he is not a fan of. Barry is what you might have pictured-- hyper, older white guy in a baseball cap. He is indeed an evangelical Christian from Boston. It takes him just a few seconds to wind himself up.

Zoe Chace
Is that part of why you would move down here? Like, it seems like a more friendly environment to evangelicals than Boston is.

Barry Chisholm
No, actually. No, I miss being up in Boston because the difference up there is if you're a Christian, you stand out like crazy. If you're a Christian down here, it's a cultural thing. And I like being around people that have strong opinions because it's fun. Because you know what? I know what I believe. And what I believe is not what I made up. It's this guy Jesus Christ who started it. So I'm globbing on to what he taught.

So it's fun. I miss being up around people who don't know about Christ and what he taught. So no, I miss that. That's probably the most fun part, is I like to engage people. And I like to turn people on. Hey, go check it out. If you don't believe me, go find out for yourself. That's the journey I had to take. And so no, I would never move down here just because--

Zoe Chace
So, I mean, also, it sounds like you kind of like living a little bit as a contrarian. Is that fair to say?

Barry Chisholm
Yeah, that's real kind of accurate. You know? Yeah, it is kind of accurate, I guess. I mean, yeah.

Zoe Chace
Barry is the guy who loves to stir the pot. Barry is a mischief maker. He is a scamp, kind of like Donald Trump. Tony and Barry, though, they started out this election season in the very same place.

Barry Chisholm
Well, I mean, I supported the Huck-- Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum before that, and then held my nose and voted for Mitt Romney. And I way back supported Reagan. So when this came around, and you had not the seven dwarfs, the 14 dwarfs out there, I mean, I just waited to see all the dust settle.

One thing about Donald Trump, I said, it will be entertaining if he gets in. It will be fun to watch because he's not a politician. I didn't realize how much fun it would be. But it's gone way beyond my expectations. It's been the most enjoyable election I've ever seen, watching all these people's heads implode. It's been a fun time.

It's been fun to watch all the establishments come unhinged because they can't control it. It's fun to watch the liberal media come out with the big hits, the names, and he's this, he's racist, and all that. I just never knew someone could take the heat and just punch back. So it's like, yeah, this is fun. This is different.

Zoe Chace
As for Ted Cruz, Barry says, forget it. He'd be killed in the mainstream media. He saw it with other strong evangelical candidates. They will just make fun of him.

But Donald Trump, he'll make fun of the mainstream media. That is such a joy to Barry. By the time the first debate happened-- you know, Megyn Kelly, the Rosie O'Donnell question-- Barry and Tony had completely opposite experiences. Tony's like, are you kidding me about Trump? But that's what Barry says about Megyn Kelly.

Barry Chisholm
Megyn Kelly had to spend a lot of time to dig up that little piece, and he made a cavalier joke. Are you kidding me? She was digging for stuff. We've got so politically correct, just like when Donald Trump said about Carly Fiorina's face. Look at that face. Look, Donald Trump-- look, if you're going to be a woman, you're going to get in the thing, then go for it. Don't be, don't be-- he's an equal opportunity basher. He'll bash guys as well as women. Stop with the baby stuff.

And the Megyn Kelly thing, it became more about her than-- this is a presidential debate.

Zoe Chace
Didn't he say, blood coming out of her wherever?

Barry Chisholm
Oh, that. Oh, that, too. And that-- oh, that was afterwards. Yeah, oh yeah. That was stupidity. I mean, there's no doubt about it. You know, is all this stuff presidential? I don't know. But you know what, this guy's not a politician.

Zoe Chace
Megyn Kelly, the wall, the ban on Muslims, all the stuff that Tony was sure would drive everyone away, Barry loves those things. Barry loves the idea, not necessarily the practice, but the fact of the statement of banning all Muslims.

Barry Chisholm
All he's bringing up is do we have a problem? And if we do, can we talk about it? Or are we gonna just, everybody's a bigot now. I mean, that's all. So Donald Trump-- we just want-- it needs to be addressed.

Zoe Chace
What I found out upon meeting Barry is one of the things he loves most about Donald Trump is arguing about Donald Trump. The conversation that is freaking Tony out so much about the state of the country, that conversation itself is the thing that Barry is relishing.

And Barry's diabolical about it. Barry has eight sons, all Trump fans, he says. And he's deployed his son David in his pro-Trump battles against Tony.

David
What'll happen is, my dad will get on there. Tony will get all flustered and upset. And every once in a while, if he's having a bad day, he'll cut him off short. So then I call right in and just kind of continue the conversation because he thinks it's a whole 'nother caller or--

Barry Chisholm
It is.

David
It is. But the whole-- so he can't avoid the Trump mindset sometimes.

Zoe Chace
Why do you do that to him?

David
It's just the challenge of it. Because they have the authority to just kick people off and make people feel stupid when they call in. A lot of people be like, well, I don't really like Trump. I'm not a Trump supporter, but, you know, he's pretty good on this issue. And Tony will be just, oh! Jump all over that.

Zoe Chace
I thought the Trump supporters I'd meet in South Carolina would be angry. But a lot of them are like Barry-- angry, but having such a great time. The people I met, they're more happy than angry. Like at this biker rally for Trump.

Kool-aid
Thanks everybody coming out for this. We're going to line our bikes up facing Market Common. So when he comes through, we're going to be about an eighth mile wide. And he'll be able to see us, see what's going on. If you're a felon or anything, leave your guns behind. You never know. They might have Secret Service there. You got a permit, by all means carry it.

That's all I got. Thanks everybody coming out.

[CHANTING "TRUMP"]

Zoe Chace
The rally was held at a biker bar in Myrtle Beach called Suck Bang Blow. It was explained to me that those are the mechanics of a combustion engine. I asked this guy Kool-Aid about Trump-- leather vest and tattoos.

Zoe Chace
So why do you like Trump so much?

Kool-aid
Well, because, I mean, he's just down to Earth. I know he's kind of loud and obnoxious. But so are all of us bikers.

Zoe Chace
Kool-Aid's never voted in his life. Today, he's throwing a Trump rally to welcome him to town. And he has voter registration cards stacked up at the bar. Steve, he'd never voted before, either.

Steve
Never ever did I give two craps who ran because I figure we're gonna get screwed anyway. But there's a difference now.

Zoe Chace
When did you register?

Steve
Three days ago.

Zoe Chace
For Trump?

Steve
Absolutely. Just figured I got to do it because, you know what? Every little bit helps. My one vote might not be much, but you know what? It might be the one that makes it rock.

Woman
I went registered last week so I can vote me some Trump.

Zoe Chace
Vote me some Trump?

Woman
Heck, yeah. We need somebody, or it's going to hell in a hand basket.

Zoe Chace
I knew these guys, first time voters, wouldn't care that they might split the Republican Party. They never felt at home there. But Barry, Tony's radio nemesis/radio frenemy, is different. So I asked him, if you go for Trump, are you going to split the party?

Barry Chisholm
Who cares? I don't care. The Republican Party needed to be split a long time ago. They troll the evangelicals. They pandered to the conservatives. And when they get in there, they do what their lobbyists tell them to do. So if the Republican Party splits, so what? All I care about America at the end of the day.

Zoe Chace
Tony, though, really cares. He does not want to lose the election. And he wonders, what does it mean about his listeners if they follow this pied piper?

Tony Beam
I think that's what's led to my current level of frustration. And I admit to you that it's greater than in the past. And I probably, quite frankly, need to dial it back a little bit because I don't need to be consumed by this. And for the last couple of weeks, I've probably been-- I mean, this has been very heavy on my mind.

Zoe Chace
And then he has this other worry, this other way of thinking about it. This worry is so personal, at first he didn't want to talk about it.

Tony Beam
I want to tell you something off the record.

Zoe Chace
Oh, OK. Oh.

But after we talked a little, he agreed to go back on mic.

Tony Beam
I mean, there've been times when I've thought about just giving up the radio show because I don't want to be one who fosters the unreasonable level of anger that's out there.

Zoe Chace
Do you think that by giving airtime to some of this stuff--

Tony Beam
Well, I have callers who call in that are very angry now. And they express things that-- and I push back. But I just wonder how many people are hearing that and going, he's right. And Dr. Beam needs to get with the program. You know?

And so I debate sometimes with myself, am I not doing anything except giving a platform? Look, Jesus Christ, when he walked this earth, condemned the zealots. He condemned the establishment, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, because they were hypocrites.

But he also condemned those who wanted to march against Rome in a violent way. That was not the path that Jesus talked about. Jesus was the Prince of Peace. He was a reconciler. I know that's what he's done in my life.

And I want to be that to represent him in the world. I don't want to be somebody that pours gas on a fire. I want to be a reconciler who brings peace in a situation where anger seems to be the prevailing thought process. And I don't know how best to do that.

But if I can't do it with a microphone, I'd just rather turn it off. It's not Trump that bothers me. What bothers me is that Trump is popular.

Ira Glass
That story from Zoe Chace, one of the produces of our show. She'll be doing campaign coverage for us all this year. Coming up, mistaking a guy who does exist for one who does not exist. That's in a minute on Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.

Act Two. My Little Bruce Dupe.

Ira Glass
This is American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our program, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, I Thought I Knew You-- stories of people misperceiving other people. Sometimes it slowly dawns on them that they have it wrong. Sometimes it comes out quickly. We've arrived at Act Two of our program. Act Two, My Little Bruce Dupe.

Well, so far on our program, we have focused on people who are misperceived. But they don't want to be misperceived. They're not doing things to create misperceptions. But, of course, sometimes people deliberately mislead other people about who they are. Comedian Jay Larson has this example--

Jay Larson
Your cell phone rings. You don't recognize the number. What do you do?

Crowd
Ignore it!

Jay Larson
Ignore it. Send it to voicemail. Yeah. Not this guy. I answer it. Yeah, exactly. Opportunity, potential, who knows? Who knows what it is?

The other day, I was driving down the 405. Traffic. Phone rings. 917, New York. I'm like, ooh, I don't know the number. I hit talk. I go, "hello?" Guy on the other line goes, "hey, Bruce. What's going on?"

My name's Jay, not Bruce. So clearly, "I go, nothing much, man. What's going on with you?"

And he goes, "I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be $15,000. Now it's $10,000. I'd like to know what the hell's going on."

And I grabbed the steering wheel. It was like, all right. Focus. Focus right now. Your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It's $15,000. Now it's $10,000. No one's happy about it. Just go with this. Go with this.

I didn't know much. I only knew what he told me. So I just said it back. And I go, "$10,000? It's supposed to be $15,000!"

He goes, "yeah, well, I just got an email, and now it's $10,000."

And I go, "hey, I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email."

And he goes, "are you behind this? Did you send it out?" Like giving Bruce some attitude, you know what I mean?

And I'm like, "no way I am taking that. There's no way."

And I go, "listen, bro. The budget was $15,000. We had a couple extra expenditures. It went up to $16,200. I reworked it, got it down to $14,700. We had $300 to play with. I called it $15,000. I sent it out."

He goes, "yeah? Well, now it's $10,000!"

And I was like, "oh, my God! That worked!" Stay focused. Stay focused I'm not even enjoying it. You know what I mean? Because I can't even laugh. I have to stay-- I'm, like, literally in it. I was just in it.

He goes, "did Larry OK this?" Now he's throwing Larry at me. Yeah.

So I go, "listen. I took it to Larry. He said it looked fine. But I knew it was my ass on the line, so I ran it by Jennifer just in case. She said it looked good. I sent it out."

He goes, "yeah? Well, now it's $10,000!"

And I was like, this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. He hasn't talked to Jennifer. I just made her up. Clearly, he has not spoken to Bruce.

He goes, "listen, man. What are we gonna do about this?"

I go, "bro, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you call Larry, check in with him? See what's going on, give me a call back." Literally like throwing the fishing line out, being like, please say yes because that phone call return is going to be amazing.

And he goes, "listen. Why don't we wait till you get home. You check the email. You call Larry. You call me back."

I go, "no, no, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back."

He goes, "OK." Hangs up the phone, to which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York somewhere that's crumbling to the ground over $5,000. No one can find Bruce. No one's talked to Larry. And they don't know who the hell Jennifer is. Excitement.

[CHEERING]

Not even done. I get home. I'm so excited. I call some friends, tell them what happened. I think to myself, you know what? I'm going to save that guy's number, give him a call in a couple days. Check in, touch base. See where we're at. I save the number on my phone under Random Guy. He's a random guy.

I don't think about it. A couple days pass. No big deal. Laying on the couch, watching the game. Phone rings, dining room table. Watching the game. Get up, pick up the phone, look down-- Random Guy.

And I think to myself, Random Guy? I don't know any Random Guy. Who the hell's Random Guy? And then I was like, oh! Random Guy!

Now I'm freaked out. You know what I mean? I'm in my house. They know where I'm at. People's lives have been affected.

But this is who I am. You know what I mean? I started this thing. I'm going to see it through the end. That's how I saw this. Put in my ear buds, just get a little distance. Just get some distance, you know I mean?

I hit Talk. I go, "hello?" Same guy goes, "hey, Larry, what's going on?" Now he's calling me Larry. He knows what's up. But I'm not gonna cave. You know what I mean?

And I go, "nothing much, man. What's going on with you?" And he goes, "listen, I got us on conference call with Jenelle and Marie." Like I'm backing down from Jenelle and Marie.

So I go, uh, "hey ladies. Welcome to the call--" as if to say, welcome to the show. Here we go. How long are we going to lie for? How long do you want me to lie? Because I'm going to go all the way.

Marie, she takes the lead. She goes, "hey, Larry. What time is it where you are?" And I look at the clock, and it's 5:30. And they're a New York company.

So I go "8:30. It's 8:30." Like, sprinkling more lies and, like, I can fool them. I can fool them.

She goes, "really? What's the weather like?" And I go, "weather's nice. Weather is nice."

She goes, "really? This doesn't sound like Larry."

And I go, "oh, yeah? Who's it sound like?"

And the guy who called both times, he chirps in. He's like, "sounds like Bruce! Sounds like Bruce!" Like he's gonna blow this case wide open.

And I go, "guys, this isn't Larry and this isn't Bruce."

And she goes, "who is this?"

And I was like, "I'm just some dude who had nothing better to do than to mess with you guys." Marie did not like that. She got pissed. She started yelling at me. She's like, "we're a small business trying!"

I'm like, "oh, I know."

She's like, "you think this is a joke?"

And I was like, "well, a little bit."

She goes, "let me ask you something."

I go, "no, you let me ask you something!"

And she goes, "what?"

And I go, "where we at with the budget?"

Act Three. A Light From the Other Side.

Ira Glass
Act Three, A Light From the Other Side. I think a lot of kids would be really shocked-- I think the right word is shocked-- at how well their teachers understand them, when teachers are good. Good teachers can talk to you forever about this kid or that kid in their class, their good qualities, their bad qualities. And when you're a student, and there's a teacher you respect, and the teacher thinks badly of you, that is just like a horrible feeling that you may or may not get to correct. Eve Abrams tells this story.

Eve Abrams
I taught elementary school for 10 years in New York City at this place called The Neighborhood School. It was one of those schools where students call teachers by their first names and where teachers really get to know their students well-- their families, their strengths, their dramas. But sometimes, one kid stands out. This is a story about one of those kids and his friend and his teacher.

Sofia is the teacher and also a friend of mine. Lilly was our student years ago. She's 16 now. And Lilly's classmate Robert was our student, too. But he's dead, so I'll let Lilly tell you about him.

Lilly Torres
I really had a hard time telling people who had died for a while because I didn't want to say friend. And I didn't want to say best friend because that makes it seem like, my best friend, like-- you know what I mean? And anyone can say that they were his best friend. I mean, he lived so close to me, so we'd hang out 24/7. We talked about everything.

In our school, everyone was pretty quiet and good. And, like, I don't know. To me, he just seemed like he was just different, and he was fun. And everyone else was boring.

Teachers never liked him. He was probably a little bit rude. Like, he didn't do his homework. That was a big thing because in the Neighborhood School, everyone was like, "oh, got to do your homework. Got to do your homework, or you're not going to go out for recess" and all this stuff. I mean, whatever. He'd be, like, never going out for recess because he never did his homework.

Eve Abrams
Robert didn't defer to adults. And other kids were drawn to that. But he was also sort of hapless. He was the kind of kid who when he cut school got caught.

Lilly Torres
He got kicked out of middle school, which was always, like, really weird to me because there were so many kids that were so much worse. I mean, there was kids that came in that school like once a week at 10 o'clock and grabbed a girl and left.

I had a crush on him, like, the second I saw him. Fifth grade was the big year that I really had a big crush on him. It was just like, oh, my god. I love you.

He one time left me flowers at my door-- it was my birthday-- and knocked on the door and ran away. And so I opened the door, and there was flowers. And I was just like, oh, my god. Oh, my god. He loves me! Like, flowers.

And so I picked it up. And there was a note. And it said from Robert to Lilly. Happy birthday. PS, don't get happy, as in, like, whatever. Don't get happy. Don't think I like you because I'm doing this. Don't get happy. I was like, but I am happy 'cause you left me flowers.

I realized it's actually because I liked him so much as a friend. And I never really had somebody that was a boy that I like so much as a friend. So I figured I must be in love with him or I must have the-- but, you know, it's also like I just actually always really liked him as a person.

Eve Abrams
That's how Lilly saw Robert. Sofia saw him differently. After he was in my class, Robert moved on to Sofia's class right next door. And a lot of times, I'd see and hear them out in the hall together. Mostly, I'd hear Sofia. She would lecture Robert about homework and effort and attitude, and her voice got really loud and annoyed. While Sofia lectured, Robert just stood there.

Sofia Pereira
Rolling his eyes. I mean, it was more a physical manifestation. Just kind of listening to me, but not really listening, kind of looking off in the distance, head was at a tilt, arms crossed, kind of waiting for the episode to end.

Eve Abrams
Sofia had a harder time with Robert than I did. He was older by the time she taught him, but his reading wasn't much better. And he still struggled with his schoolwork. He'd also gotten really good at deflecting all of the things that teachers would try-- ordering, cajoling, tricking. Sofia would see Robert around the neighborhood after school, hanging out with older boys, doing nothing much. And it frustrated her to no end that this smart, charming kid seemed headed for a lifetime of dead-end jobs and disappointments.

Sofia Pereira
At one point, when I was getting near the end of my rope, I talked to his family about making him stay after school in the classroom just so he can get his homework done. And I think we did it for like a week or two. And I don't think it was very successful. It wasn't a habit he could replicate at home.

Eve Abrams
Incidents between Sofia and Robert piled up, and the year ended badly between them. Someone wrote an obscenity about Sofia on the school wall, up high where only a tall kid could write. And our principal was convinced it was Robert. He ended up being banned from the big end-of-the-year party. When Robert didn't show up at graduation, other kids at the school, including Lilly, blamed Sofia, even though Sofia had nothing to do with it. Not going had been Robert's decision.

Mostly, Sofia felt she'd done the best that she could with Robert. But she wasn't sure. She felt bad when she thought about him-- bad for not reaching him, bad for having been hard on him. And for the next few years, she dreaded seeing Robert around the neighborhood, especially with other kids she knew, like Lilly. And then one day, Sofia heard Robert was dead, stabbed to death for reasons no one knows even today. He had just turned 16 two weeks before.

Sofia Pereira
After Robert was killed, I had this nightmare. I dreamt that, I don't know, two or three of the girls in that class were really upset with me. And they were talking about the time when I had asked Robert to stay after school and work on his homework. One of the girls had accused me of preventing him from joining a basketball league. And she said that because I didn't let him do that and because I made him stay after school to work on his homework, he didn't get a chance to make better friends and do something that was better for him and more productive. And I really felt like maybe they have something there.

Eve Abrams
If nothing else had happened, Robert would have stayed like that in Sofia's head for years, a kid she always had regrets about, always wished she'd done a better job with. But about six weeks after Robert died, Lilly came back to her old elementary school and showed up in Sofia's classroom out of the blue. And she did something none of our students had ever done.

Sofia Pereira
I was surprised to see her, of all people, in my room, in my class, visiting me. And then she said, well, I wanted to give you this. And she handed me a note that she'd written. And then she left.

And then when I read the note, I couldn't believe-- I just couldn't believe it. I had to read the letter over again. I keep it in my wallet. I wanted to frame it, but sometimes I feel like I just need to read that letter again, just to remind me.

Eve Abrams
Would you mind getting it now?

Sofia Pereira
Sure, I'll read it.

[PAPER UNFOLDING]

Dear Sofia, This is a letter of appreciation to you from me and Rob. Thank you very much for coming to Rob's wake. I know it would have meant so much to him to see how many people showed up. In the past three years-- well, four years-- since me and Rob left the Neighborhood School, we have been best friends, together every day.

I just wanted to let you know how much Rob appreciated what you did for him as a teacher. Whenever we would talk about the past, he said that he understood everything you did for him and that he was grateful for it. He showed me that people care for you. That's why sometimes they are harsh. For that reason, I thank you for teaching it to him. Rob always liked when people showed him they cared. He cared for you very much. Hope to see you soon. Lilly Torres.

Eve Abrams
Lilly wrote the note to Sofia on an impulse while she was grieving. She wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do, or if it was weird, or even if Robert would approve. But before she could talk herself out of it, she sat down at her kitchen counter and wrote it on a pink Post-it.

Lilly Torres
I think the thing is, I really wanted people to know that he was a really great person. I mean, you know, teachers were just always not liking him. And I just maybe thought, yeah, maybe even if one teacher that he had knew that he liked them or that-- you know, not to change his reputation with every teacher that he ever had. But I was just trying to take a little bit of that off of his name because I don't think he really deserved any bad at all.

He was so mature about that whole thing about her. And I wasn't at all. And I wanted-- I thought maybe by showing her that that she would know that he actually turned out pretty well. He said, "I'm not mad because I think that she was trying to do the best thing that she could for me." Because we were talking about Sofia. I was just kind of like, "she didn't know how to handle you."

And he was like, "what are you talking about, she didn't know how to handle me? I was bad. And she was just trying to help me." And he said that he was thankful that she took the time out to even care about him, even if it was yelling or whatever it was. He said that it showed him that she cared.

Eve Abrams
Sofia never wrote back to Lilly. She'd wanted to find the perfect way to thank her, but she couldn't decide what to say. And then she figured too much time had passed. Though Lilly doesn't see it that way.

Sofia Pereira
It's fine if she doesn't write me back or if she does. I don't think it's ever too late. You just never know what people need to know.

Eve Abrams
Until I spoke to her, Lilly had no idea how much her note had meant to Sofia, that Sofia kept the note in her wallet, that it had lifted away years of guilt. For Lilly, the note was about saving Robert, the part of him that was left in the world. She hadn't realized that it would also rescue Sofia.

Ira Glass
Eve Abrams. That's actually a story that we first broadcast eight years ago. Sofia is still a teacher at the same school. Lilly, the 16-year-old, now has a master's in music business and works at Electric Lady Studios.

Act Four. I Thought I Knew U2.

Ira Glass
Act Four. OK, so our theme today is I Thought I Knew You. And Act Four of our show today is titled I Thought I Knew U2. There's this podcast about U2, the band U2, that's done by Adam Scott from Parks and Rec and Scott Aukerman, who you may know from Comedy Bang Bang! And, you know, they're really into U2, as you would expect from people who are making a podcast about U2. So they sit and they talk about the band, and they break down their albums, that kind of thing.

And they did this thing not long ago where into this den of intense U2 fandom, they brought somebody who knows nothing about U2, a comedian named Todd Glass, who also has his own podcast. No relation to me, by the way. And what happens is just this very fun to listen to matter-antimatter collision. Todd Glass explains that he doesn't know really much about music, about any band. And let's just pick it up from there.

Todd Glass
U2 I know-- here's when it comes into the part I don't know. The lead singer gets-- of U2, what is his name?

Scott Aukerman
We're not going to tell you.

Todd Glass
He gets teased a lot for taking himself too seriously. Like, he's in the world hunger--

Adam Scott
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Scott Aukerman
We're not going to tell you anything. I want to hear everything you know about U2.

Todd Glass
Well, I know that, oh, there's so much right on the-- there's a song about, about, uh-- isn't there a song that he did for some big, like, event to raise money for some-- like it was like really-- I'm sure there's a lot of songs. But this was written for one thing particular. No?

Scott Aukerman
No. I don't know. I'm just wondering what you know.

Todd Glass
Goddammit, can't you give me his first name? I'm picturing him with his big glasses. And he has his hair sort of thinning up top.

Adam Scott
What else about U2?

Scott Aukerman
What else do you know about U2? Life experiences? Anything.

Todd Glass
I just know he wears those--

Scott Aukerman
Any contact you--

Adam Scott
Songs?

Todd Glass
Big glasses. No, I don't-- if you told me a song, I would genuinely, like, as it's coming out your mouth. One of those things. I'd be like, oh, yeah!

Scott Aukerman
So that's what you know. You could not even tell us one name of one song.

Todd Glass
No. But if you played songs--

Scott Aukerman
Can I play something?

Todd Glass
I would know if you played something. But seriously, don't tell me if it's going to be it or not. Don't just play his song. I'll tell you if it's his song or not in a heartbeat, I bet.

Scott Aukerman
OK. So I'll play a song.

Todd Glass
And I'll know if it's his song or not, in a heartbeat, I would imagine. Maybe I'm wrong.

Scott Aukerman
OK. So I'm going to play a song. You tell me if this is a U2 song sung by Bono.

Todd Glass
OK. And I'm gonna-- just so you know, I think I could know pretty quick.

[MUSIC - "BAKER STREET" BY GERRY RAFFERTY]

No. It doesn't have enough soul.

Scott Aukerman
OK.

Todd Glass
Would I be right to say that?

Scott Aukerman
You are. That was Gerry Rafferty, "Baker Street."

Todd Glass
Yeah.

Scott Aukerman
All right.

Todd Glass
Well, the next one is gonna be him probably.

Scott Aukerman
All right. Here we go. Ready?

[MUSIC - "HEY NINETEEN" BY STEELY DAN]

Todd Glass
No. No.

Scott Aukerman
You're right. This is Steely Dan, "Hey Nineteen." All right. One of these is gonna be U2.

Todd Glass
OK.

Scott Aukerman
All right. You ready?

Todd Glass
Uh-huh.

[MUSIC - "BUDDY HOLLY" BY WEEZER]

I'm gonna say no.

Scott Aukerman
You are right. That is Weezer, "Buddy Holly."

Adam Scott
This is one of the greatest moments of my life, just listening to this.

Scott Aukerman
All right. Ready?

Todd Glass
OK.

Scott Aukerman
All right. Here we go.

Todd Glass
At this point, it's got to be it.

[MUSIC - "SLEDGEHAMMER" BY PETER GABRIEL]

Yes. No. Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on! OK.

Todd Glass
Don't-- let me answer. This is I'm older, but yes. It's an older work of his, but yes.

Scott Aukerman
Incorrect. This is Peter Gabriel, "Sledgehammer."

Todd Glass
Ah, [BLEEP]. I knew it wasn't it, but here's what happened-- my instincts where that it wasn't it. But I thought, well, how many will he play before it's it? So I said, don't trust your instincts.

Scott Aukerman
Can I just play you a song?

Todd Glass
Well, yeah. Finally, at this point, I think it would be better for me.

Scott Aukerman
All right. I'm trying to think of what song you would know.

Todd Glass
I'm going to look away. You decide.

Scott Aukerman
All right. OK. OK. Here's-- all right. This is-- OK. I think this is the song that you would know. Hold on.

[MUSIC - "WHERE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME" BY GARY PORTNOY]

Todd Glass
No, this isn't him. No.

Adam Scott
This is him.

Todd Glass
No it isn't. Oh.

[LAUGHTER]

Scott Aukerman
I'm pretty sure this is him.

Adam Scott
This is definitely him.

Scott Aukerman
This isn't him?

Todd Glass
All right, look.

Scott Aukerman
All right.

Todd Glass
Scott.

Scott Aukerman
Yes.

Todd Glass
No bull [BLEEP]. Play the song. Look me in the eye, and play a real song. And stop [BLEEP] around here.

Scott Aukerman
All right. I got to find it.

Todd Glass
I'll be able to tell.

Scott Aukerman
I got to find it.

Todd Glass
Just play the song. Seriously.

Scott Aukerman
OK. Uh--

Todd Glass
Scott, look me in the eye!

Scott Aukerman
I am looking you in the eye, yes.

Todd Glass
OK.

Scott Aukerman
OK.

Todd Glass
Let me just hear a YouTube-- a U2 song.

Scott Aukerman
All right. Here we go. This is U2.

Todd Glass
I'll recognize it.

Scott Aukerman
This is probably U2's most famous song, I would say, out of all of them.

Todd Glass
Yeah. Don't play something new. Play--

[MUSIC - "BLUEBERRY HILL" BY FATS DOMINO]

I knew this was them. OK. Now really play their song.

Scott Aukerman
OK. Here's the real--

Todd Glass
Now I really do want to hear it.

Scott Aukerman
Oh, it's connecting. All right.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

All right. Here's a new song. Is this U2?

Todd Glass
Yes. I know this song. Jesus Christ, you know how exhausted I am?

Adam Scott
Yeah, I would imagine.

Scott Aukerman
Oh, that was fun.

Todd Glass
I'm literally out of breath.

Adam Scott
I could have done that forever, though. Just listened to--

Scott Aukerman
I loved it.

[MUSIC - "I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR" BY U2]

Ira Glass
OK, you're a middle school teacher. Here's a situation that apparently happens all the time. A kid walks into your classroom wearing a hat. There's a rule-- hats are not allowed in school. You tell him to take it off. He does.

Ten minutes later, you're teaching, you look at the kid, he's wearing the hat again. Again, you tell him to take it off. This time, he doesn't. And then he escalates the situation. He curses to himself. What do you do?

Serena Nickle
Right then and there, I'd say, "That response was not acceptable, and I won't tolerate that. Take off your hat, and put it into your bookbag."

Ira Glass
Serena Nickle in Connecticut says that usually works. You demand compliance. Though one of our producers, Chana Joffe-Walt, asked over a dozen middle school teachers. Jose Vilson in New York would have a very different response.

Jose Vilson
"Let's have a conversation."

Chana Joffe-walt
So like, you're in the middle of teaching, and you would say, "John, let's have a conversation about your hat?"

Jose Vilson
Yeah. Absolutely.

Ira Glass
Jeff Reamer says that the key is no conversation, no stopping instruction at all, as he gives the kid a demerit on the kid's weekly behavior report.

Jeff Reamer
If I'm saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, today, we are going to talk about three different styles of argumentation-- John, right now, you're choosing to earn a major deduction, because you put the hat back on. Please take it off. We're choosing to learn about the three different types of argumentative styles-- ethos, logos, and pathos." It'd be like that.

Ira Glass
Smooth, right? Jamien Jacobs in Maine would not use any words at all. She'd give the kid a look. She'd do the whole thing in a look.

Jamien Jacobs
If he doesn't take off the hat, one of my techniques is I take my shoe off, and I chuck it.

Chana Joffe-walt
What?

Jamien Jacobs
[LAUGHS].

Chana Joffe-walt
You take your-- wait. You take your shoe off?

Jamien Jacobs
Yeah. Like if I'm wearing clogs, I'd take off my shoe, and I'd put it in my hand, and I'd say, "OK, take off the hat, or I'm going to chuck it."

Chana Joffe-walt
Like, "I'm going to chuck it at you?"

Jamien Jacobs
Well, they never know. But I've thrown plenty of shoes, and kids love that, too.

Ira Glass
All across the country, across different schools in different states, when it comes to disciplining young people, teachers are winging it. In 19 states, you're still allowed to hit kids if they think that'll work. And lots do. Chana asked the teachers what they learned about controlling their classrooms in their teacher training programs. Most of them said, not much.

There's this great book that's out now by a reporter named Elizabeth Green, about teacher training. It says, "Incredibly, at some education schools, disciplining kids, managing your class, it's not even a subject on the curriculum." When you ask teachers, OK, so really, how did you learn to do that thing that you do with your voice, your face, your shoe, they often answer with a name, a kid's name-- that kid taught me so much.

Male Teacher 1
I had this one student, Alex, who-- I'd tried everything.

Female Teacher 1
His name was Jeff.

Male Teacher 2
I'll call her Z.

Male Teacher 3
I'll give her the name J. Yeah, J.

Female Teacher 2
We'll call him Johnny. We'll call him Johnny.

Ira Glass
Johnny and Z and Jeff and Alex are our nation's education school. These are the kids who were so hard to discipline that teachers just had to figure out what to do. So each teacher finds an approach that works for them.

Does it work for the kids? Who knows? There's no clear answer. There's no best practice that educators agree on.

Which is weird, since this is where kids should be learning to control themselves and how to live with others in the world. It's so essential. This is so basic. And there are lots of educators out there who are convinced that the way that we do discipline isn't just ineffective. They think it's actively messing kids up.

So today, we're going to talk about schools, but not about curriculum or testing or standards or any of the other stuff that people usually talk about on the radio and in the media when they talk about schools. Today, we're going to talk about discipline, because, you know, you kind of have to nail discipline before you can do anything else in a classroom.

Chana Joffe-Walt has been looking into this for months. She has learned things are not going so great with discipline. And lots of educators and parents are asking, is this working? Is this the best we can do? From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Stay with us.

Act One. Time Out.

Ira Glass
Act One, "Time Out."

OK, so let's start this show about discipline in schools at the very beginning of a kid's school experience, in preschool, with kids so young that you would think it would be pretty straightforward how to handle behavioral problems when they act up. Like, how bad can these kids be? And at this young age, this is where the question first emerges of whether the wrong kind of discipline in school will screw up a kid, maybe for years to come. Here's Chana.

Chana Joffe-walt
JJ's conversational style is to tell you things he knows for sure. He's no fan of ambiguity, sticks with the facts. He's five. He does not like salad. His new house is OK, but it does not have a pantry.

He can spell the word "loss." His mom has a belly, because there's a baby in there. The baby will have brown skin. And he knows this because his mom said it is for sure, for sure. He does not like salad.

Jj
I do like the onions in it. I eat them a lot. But I do not eat the salad. I just eat the chicken, 'cause the chicken goes with the salad. And I don't eat the salad.

Chana Joffe-walt
JJ just started kindergarten. I ask him what preschool was like before kindergarten. He tells me, "I was in green room with Miss Bethany and I-don't-remember-her-name lady. There were three racecars." More blocks than a number he knows.

Later, I talk to JJ's mom, Tunette Powell. And she told me a very different story about JJ's time in preschool. She says, last January, she was in the car on the way to a meeting.

Tunette Powell
They called my husband, and my husband called me. And my husband said, "We need to pick up JJ." And I said, "Pick him up?" And he said, "Yeah. They said he threw a chair and he needs to go home."

And I'm like, are you kidding? That he threw a chair? I'm not saying that he can't do anything, but he is the little guy who I worry about, because, even if him and his brother, who's two years younger than him, if his brother hits him, he will cry. Very, very sensitive and not very aggressive at all.

Chana Joffe-walt
Still, as she exited the highway, she did a special form of mental gymnastics I believe is familiar to parents everywhere.

Tunette Powell
You know, automatically, then you're thinking, wow, I failed as a parent. It was difficult.

Chana Joffe-walt
You went right there? You went to, I failed as a parent?

Tunette Powell
I did. That's immediately where I went.

Chana Joffe-walt
When Tunette got to the school, the woman at the front desk gave her a form that said JJ threw a chair. She asked Tunette to sign it. So she did.

Tunette Powell
We're not people who just say, oh, blame the school or blame the teacher or, oh, it's somebody else's problem. I mean, we immediately looked at what do we need to do to right the ship. This is not OK. I mean, we told him, you're going to go to your room. And I talked to him about everything.

And we thought, OK, he seems like he understood. And so I thought, OK, this is a one-time thing, never happen again. And then, in the same week, JJ was at school for about 30 minutes. And they called me.

They said that he had been crying at the breakfast table. And they didn't know why he was crying. That they kept asking him why he was crying, and he would not tell them why he was crying.

And then he pushed a chair again. And neither of the times, he didn't hit anybody. But of course, he could have.

Chana Joffe-walt
JJ was sent to his room again. No cartoons, no fruit snacks. A couple weeks after that, JJ spit on another kid. He got sent home again.

Tunette asked for more information this time. And there was a long back-and-forth about the definition of "spit on." It was not projectile; more like dribble.

And at home, they did the same routine-- you're going to go to your room, no treats. But Tunette worried JJ didn't seem to understand that, when he was bad at school, being sent home was a punishment. Tunette didn't think he got that connection.

Tunette Powell
I don't. I think he almost saw it as a good thing, where, yes, it was sad, because Mommy wasn't happy with me. But at the same time, when I pick them up at school, they're not running away from me; they're running to me.

Chana Joffe-walt
Do you know what a suspension is?

Jj
I don't know.

Chana Joffe-walt
Have you heard that word before?

Jj
Yes.

Chana Joffe-walt
And what does it mean?

Jj
I forgot. But I do have Captain Damerica. He's the guy with the shield.

Chana Joffe-walt
Captain what?

Jj
Captain Damerica.

Chana Joffe-walt
So yeah, I don't think he got it. And of course he didn't. He was four years old at the time. To me, it sounds crazy to suspend a four-year-old. Like, there has got to be a better way to get your message across.

It didn't seem like it was messing him up or anything. JJ didn't seem traumatized. It just didn't look like it was working.

Then, after the third time he was suspended, Tunette started to feel like there was only one explanation for why it wasn't working. And it wasn't her parenting or the school. It wasn't JJ.

It was her. She was a problem student when she was a kid. And she felt like, somehow, she passed that on to her son. She disrupted class a lot, got in fights.

Tunette Powell
I got in trouble all the time as a kid. I was suspended frequently. So when my kids started getting suspended, it's like--

Chana Joffe-walt
But you weren't suspended in preschool.

Tunette Powell
Yes. Yes. I was suspended and expelled from preschool. Mm-hm.

Chana Joffe-walt
Like three, four years old?

Tunette Powell
Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. And so when I see my own kids getting suspended from school, you know, my kids are me. So I got in trouble a lot when I was little.

My kids are me. Doesn't matter if the situation's different. It doesn't even matter. They're just me.

Chana Joffe-walt
It had mattered greatly to Tunette that the situation would be different for her kids. She spent the last decade taking one enormous step after another away from her childhood. Her dad was in prison when she was a kid. Her children have a father. Her mom never had enough money.

She and her husband moved to Omaha so Tunette's husband could be in the Air Force. They have a steady income, four bedrooms, and a lawn. Tunette went into kindergarten knowing she was a bad kid. And she lived up to that reputation all the way through school.

Tunette Powell
But my kids seem so different. They seem like-- my kids are so good. They're so happy. They're so full of life. They just seemed a lot different than I did at three or four.

And they're so well-behaved at home and in public, when we go to restaurants and any of these places like that. Anywhere we take them, to the mall, anywhere, people are just always stopping us and saying, how are your kids so well behaved? So the fact that that was not very consistent at school just broke my heart.

Chana Joffe-walt
A few weeks after JJ was first suspended, Tunette took him to a birthday party.

Tunette Powell
And this is where, at this point, remember, I'm feeling really low on myself, I guess my parenting skills. And so I go to this birthday party. And it's for his friend, one of his little friends.

And all the parents are kind of talking, all the women parents. And we're talking about the preschool. And some of them are saying things that they like and don't like and all these different things. And then I said, well, JJ's been suspended. And they were like, suspended? And I'm like, yeah.

And they said, they suspend kids? They were shocked. And I said, absolutely. I said, he's been suspended, and I started telling them all the things that he had done.

And then one parent's like, I wonder why my kid hasn't been suspended. And I'm like, hm? What? So then she says, well, my son, he hit this kid on purpose, and they had to rush that kid to the hospital, and all I got was a phone call. And I was like, hm. And one after another, they kept telling me different stuff-- my kid did this, my kid did that, my kid bit somebody, my kid-- all these things.

And my kids, they're all the same age, all the same class. And only JJ had been sent home. So I was like, what is going on? That's when I thought to myself, something is not right.

Chana Joffe-walt
The other parents were white at this birthday party?

Tunette Powell
The other parents were white. It was three other parents and myself. And they were white. And where we live, the majority of the kids are white.

And I'm not a person who does that, oh, everything's against black people, or I don't wake up and look for situations where there's discrimination or racism or any of that. So I wasn't-- oh, they're just doing this because my kids are black. I had no reason to believe that. After that birthday party, it forced me to consider it.

Chana Joffe-walt
After the birthday party, Tunette's younger son, Joah, got suspended. Joah was three, though just barely three. He'd just had his birthday that week.

Tunette writes for a local Omaha parenting blog called Momaha. She wrote a post with the headline, "Is My Black Preschooler Just Another Statistic?"

I reached out to the preschool. And they did not want to comment or even allow me to talk to the director of the school. But Tunette's post got picked up by the Washington Post. And she started getting dozens of messages, especially from black parents, all over the country.

Tunette Powell
In every part, every little sector, just saying that this has happened to me, and I thought I was by myself.

Chana Joffe-walt
Tunette was very much not by herself. This is not a new conversation for lots of black and Latino parents noticing that their kids seem to be punished more harshly than white kids. That's not new.

What is new is that some academics and activists have been taking these stories and attaching them to a new, provocative term-- "the school-to-prison pipeline." The idea is that what's happening to Tunette's son is happening to lots of kids of color all over the country. And once those kids are old enough, the excessive punishment in school really messes them up and makes them much more likely to wind up in prison.

Michael Thompson
Yeah, you'd hear stories from advocates who would talk about a school-to-prison pipeline.

Chana Joffe-walt
Michael Thompson is the director of the Council of State Governments Justice Center. It's a nonpartisan think-tanky type place. And Thompson kept hearing that term, "school-to-prison pipeline."

His job is to advise lawmakers on crime policy. So he was getting asked a lot, is this a real thing? Are black and Latino kids really punished more in school and ending up in prison because of it? It seemed a little far-fetched to Michael Thompson.

Michael Thompson
Um, you know, I think everything's more complicated than that.

Chana Joffe-walt
Thompson likes numbers. He enjoys being in close proximity to Microsoft Excel. And this is exactly the kind of assignment he does not like, because there are not consistent numbers on discipline in schools. Every school is different, every district, every state.

And then, Michael Thompson learned about Texas. Texas, somewhat miraculously, had followed every single public school student from seventh grade through graduation-- the seventh graders of 2000, 2001, 2002. And they had documented everything-- report cards, if the kid was poor, Asian, switched schools, gotten in trouble, followed them all the way through graduation.

So Thomson could ask the researchers in College Station at Texas A&amp;M, how many white kids were suspended? For what? How many times? Which schools?

Michael Thompson
I was just-- all these numbers. The image I have is these guys in Texas A&amp;M with white lab coats. We would joke that all the lights would dim in College Station each time they would run an analysis of this thing, because it was such a massive data set.

Chana Joffe-walt
The lab coats peered down at a million students' lives-- the schools they attended, how they did, when they got in trouble. And they determined that African American and Hispanic students were twice as likely to receive an out-of-school suspension than their white peers for their first offense. When they looked at African American boys in Texas, 83% were suspended at least once. And usually, they were suspended a lot more than once. That includes anything a school calls suspension.

But still, take 10 black boys, two of them made it through middle and high school without being suspended. And what kind of infractions were they getting suspended for? Most of the time, these were not for big things, like hitting a teacher or bringing a weapon to school. They were for things like disrespect, insubordination, willful defiance, the kind of incident that often begins when an angry kid won't take his hat off.

OK, and one more striking thing you can see in the Texas numbers-- kids who were suspended were much more likely to be arrested outside of school, three times as likely to come into contact with the juvenile justice system.

Michael Thompson
To be honest, it was a little bit of a spine-tingling moment, because I kept thinking about how city advocates had been saying this is such a common event. And my instant reaction was, this is going to give a whole lot more credibility to this conversation than we've ever had before.

Chana Joffe-walt
They're right. I mean, what you're saying is you've just found that they're right.

Michael Thompson
Yeah. At that point, that's right.

Chana Joffe-walt
The idea of suspending a young person for bad behavior-- what is that? A kid who's disrespectful or insubordinate does not want to be in class. So you suspend them? Just saying that out loud, that sounds weird, right?

A couple years ago, the state of Maryland wrote a law-- state legislator sat down and wrote this law-- that says you cannot suspend students for being truant. If a kid skips school, you can't punish him by telling him, you can't come to school. They needed a law to make that clear.

I talked to a sociologist named Pedro Noguera who told me that, over the last few decades, suspensions have become the go-to move in response to disruptive behavior, for everyone, actually, but especially black and Hispanic kids.

Pedro Noguera
Denying them learning time, which is, I think, the most ridiculous part of it.

Chana Joffe-walt
And because of the Texas numbers, we now know that those same kids are at a much higher risk of being arrested. So is there a connection here? One way to look at this is just that our society gives tougher punishments to black and Hispanic kids when they are JJ's age, when they're in preschool, and when they're in high school, and when they're old enough to go to prison. The issue is not school. It's just racism.

But Noguera says school is an important part of this picture. And here's the theory he laid out for me. You suspend a kid, he misses school, he finds it hard to catch up, he feels frustrated, falls behind. And maybe just as important, he learns he is bad. Because he feels bad when he's in school, he acts bad.

Pedro Noguera
There's this assumption that, if we get rid of the bad people, that the good people will be able to learn, the good people will be safe. What we continue to ignore is that we are producing the bad people. We're producing in school the bad behavior.

Chana Joffe-walt
Producing it through the system of punishment that convinces some kids that they're bad.

In May, 2011, Michael Thompson got a meeting with the Attorney General of the United States. And he showed him the Texas numbers. And two months later, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education were standing together at a press conference about discipline in schools. They started gathering their own numbers from schools, all over the country this time. And those numbers were worse, even in preschool.

In March this year, the Department of Education issued a report that said black children make up 18% of preschoolers, but they make up 48% of preschool children suspended more than once.

Tunette Powell
When I found that, it was the same month as the birthday party. And I saw the story and the way it just said that black children are suspended at much higher rates. So I'm thinking to myself, in the same few months that my kids were being suspended, I go to this birthday party, and then I see this report.

Chana Joffe-walt
I asked Tunette what the report meant to her. And she found it hard to summarize so many things.

Tunette Powell
First, when I saw the report, it made me feel like my kids were a target. It just felt like they were a target. I felt like my kids-- is this something that I have to worry about forever? Is this not something that I could just say was this one-time little thing? It's like something that I'll always have to be aware of and always have to think about and always have to be more involved than the next parent in my kids' lives at school because of these studies.

And then, second, the report just kind of made me feel like maybe I wasn't as bad.

Chana Joffe-walt
She's talking about herself there, as a kid. Remember, Tunette was a problem student herself, preschool through high school graduation.

Chana Joffe-walt
Maybe I could have been-- maybe, since there's such this overwhelming number, maybe that meant that the teachers weren't always doing the right thing.

Even as she's saying that, Tunette isn't quite sure she believes it. She remembers being bad. She flipped over a desk in class one time. That happened. But she also remembers that, after getting suspended in preschool, she walked into kindergarten fully convinced the teacher was the enemy. And that never went away.

All those times she was suspended, she didn't come back less angry, ready to obediently follow directions. It was the opposite. Tunette says, "I went into kindergarten knowing I was bad. I went into first grade knowing I was terrible. And it just went up from there."

Ira Glass
Chana Joffe-Walt. Coming up, two ambitious, totally interesting, and completely opposite attempts to do discipline differently in schools. That's in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.

Act Two. The Guinea Pig Becomes the Scientist.

Ira Glass
It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Today's program, discipline in schools-- is it working? Is it messing kids up? One of our producers, Chana Joffe-Walt, has been looking into that for months.

And in this half of our program, we look at two approaches to discipline that teachers are trying in schools in poor, urban neighborhoods. There's a pattern that teachers see in a lot of these schools. The pattern is this-- the kids walk in on day one, they're already stressed out by the environments they come from, and they act out. So they get punished.

They get the message that they're bad. They come to hate school. They act out some more.

Katie Furr
I had a kid throw a bathroom stall door out the window from the third floor. And I got in trouble, because I let him go to the bathroom.

Ira Glass
Katie Furr first taught at a middle school in New York City in Washington Heights with tons of kids who acted out. There were fights.

Katie Furr
It didn't really feel like anybody was in charge, except this one eighth grader. He actually yelled down the hall one day, "I run this mother." And I realized he did.

Ira Glass
Often, she would just lose control of her class because of this kid named Christopher, a curly-haired 14-year-old with braces who gave her more trouble than anybody else in the class. Like one day, Christopher left class to go to the bathroom. And Ms. Furr took his coat. And she locked it in a closet with all the other kids' coats. There was a school policy in that school to lock up coats like that to make it harder for the kids to leave school in the middle of the day.

Katie Furr
He came back in, and he was like, where's my coat? And one of the other kids was like, Ms. Furr locked it in the closet. And he was like, you steal my stuff, I'm going to steal your stuff.

He walked over to my desk. He's taking staplers, he's throwing papers. He's like, throwing stuff around the room. He's putting stuff in his backpack, in his pockets.

And the security guard came in, and he didn't really know what to do. And I mean, Christopher's running circles around the security guard, my Post-Its falling out of his pants pocket. It was just ridiculous.

Ira Glass
In reaction to the kind of chaotic public school where learning is interrupted a lot and so kids fall further behind, two decades ago, some teachers launched one of the biggest recent experiments in American education, a whole movement of charter schools designed for poor minority kids. The idea is that the classrooms are rigorous, high standards, long school days. When it comes to discipline, they are strict, they're orderly, they are hyper-vigilant. There's a slogan they use-- they sweat the small stuff, so things never get to the point they did in Ms. Furr's class.

These kinds of charter schools have now been around long enough that the first generation of students who went through them are grown. And some of those students now look back on their time in those schools. And they think about, did it work? What worked? What didn't work?

In this act, Act Two-- we're calling this act "The Guinea Pig Becomes the Scientist"-- Chana talked with one of those students who grew up and decided to become a teacher himself.

Chana Joffe-walt
Being a human subject is a thing that ranks pretty high on Rousseau Mieze's "who I am" list. He grew up in Roxbury, Mass. His parents are Haitian immigrants. And at age 10 years old, Rousseau became a human test subject when his mom signed him up to be part of the first sixth-grade class at the Academy of the Pacific Rim.

Rousseau Mieze
I like to think of it as first generation charter school. Students are silent. Students are sitting up straight. There's just no room in a classroom for students not following directions or following the rules or doing what they are asked to do. And version 1.0 of that was, like, my second day of school, I got suspended, sent home, because I celebrated-- because I got 100 on a math quiz, one of those Math Minutes.

Chana Joffe-walt
You got suspended for celebrating a math--

Rousseau Mieze
For talking, talking out of turn.

Chana Joffe-walt
Wait. What'd you say?

Rousseau Mieze
"Yes! Yes! I got 100 on my Math Minutes." But I said it out loud.

Chana Joffe-walt
Suspension?

Rousseau Mieze
Yeah.

Chana Joffe-walt
Rousseau's teachers had spent years coming up with the theories that created that first week of school. They wanted to close the achievement gap with long school days and high expectations. They have lots of slogans-- no excuses, zero tolerance for misbehavior. And Rousseau's teachers believed this approach would motivate the kids to behave. Which it did, for some kids. And for some kids, it did not.

Rousseau Mieze
I was definitely one of the-- how to put this? I got in trouble a lot, like, a lot. And so--

Chana Joffe-walt
What kinds of things were you doing?

Rousseau Mieze
Impulse control. Talking. Talking, talking, talking, talking, talking. Yeah, that was most of it.

Chana Joffe-walt
A few of Rousseau's childhood teachers went on to start their own schools, went on to scale up their vision of rigorous, no-excuses schools for America's poor and minority students. Rousseau's former teachers now write books and talk about the mistakes they made early on and all the important lessons they took from those mistakes, things like, don't shame students by making them stand with their nose to the chalkboard for the rest of the class. Don't make them bark like a dog. It is not best practice to throw chairs in order to get kids to see you're serious. And when a kid is late, do not do what a teacher did to Rousseau.

Rousseau Mieze
He's like, where were you? [MIMICKING YELLING] And I'm like, sorry. I didn't realize-- and then he's like, get out He yells at me and screams at me to leave the classroom.

And then I get up, and I'm walking. And he goes, walk faster! And screams at me to walk faster. I was so distraught, breathing heavy, crying, just uncontrollable anger and rage at that time. It felt like that.

Chana Joffe-walt
You're still mad about it.

Rousseau Mieze
I'm really angry about it, like really angry about it. To this day, I can't say this guy's name. I can't even-- yeah. It's really bad.

Chana Joffe-walt
For Rousseau, there was a big upside to his charter school experience. He got into college. He doesn't think that would have happened otherwise. And it gave him the life he has today.

But there were downsides, too. For one, lots of kids couldn't hack it, left the school. Less than half of Rousseau's sixth grade class stayed till graduation. And some of the charter movement's leaders say too many of those who did make it to college ended up dropping out. One reason for that-- after all the strict control in high school, they floundered when they had no structure in college.

When Rousseau aged out of being a human test subject, he pretty much immediately moved over to the other side and became a teacher. He got his first gig when he was still in college, a sort of teaching internship at a charter school in Rochester. He was 21 years old. And he finally had the distance to see things from the outside. He chaperoned his first field trip to DC, and it kind of freaked him out.

Rousseau Mieze
And it was just so intense. Kids were single-file lines out of buses, single-file lines lined up in front of a bathroom at a rest stop. Monitors had to go into the bathrooms. Kids had to silently use the bathrooms, wash their hands.

Chana Joffe-walt
And Rousseau noticed that the kids were getting noticed. Grownups around them were smiling, pointing them out.

Rousseau Mieze
I think that there's some of it that's just like, kids and teenagers? Wow, I've never seen a group of teenagers silently walk into a bathroom, because who sees that? But also, I think there's a race thing that plays in there, too, where you're like, wow, look at a group of minority children in a rest stop, sort of, like, behaving.

Chana Joffe-walt
Rousseau was good with kids, especially the problem kids. When he graduated from college, he got a job through his charter connections. And Rousseau proceeded to be maybe the only rookie teacher in America who did not struggle with classroom management. Seriously, he was a genius at controlling the kids. The thing Rousseau struggled with was letting go of control.

By this point, the strict charters had pulled back some on the extreme discipline model. The slogans were still "zero tolerance," "no excuses." But Rousseau also heard a new one-- "power versus purpose." Make sure, when you are exerting your power, there's a reason for it.

Is there a reason kids need to walk quietly into a rest stop on a field trip? Is there a reason you need that kid to unpack his bookbag silently? There might be. But you know, ask the question. Rousseau said school felt so different than he remembered.

Rousseau Mieze
I saw kids laugh and have fun in school. I saw kids learn about commas through-- like one of my coworkers, Angar, he came in as Barack O-comma. And I saw that. I experienced students learn and did really well on the Rhode Island state test, killed the state. But they were having such a good time.

Chana Joffe-walt
And was that the first time that you had seen that?

Rousseau Mieze
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

Chana Joffe-walt
And you were like, oh, my god, school can be this way.

Rousseau Mieze
It can be fun. And it was crazy to me.

Chana Joffe-walt
Rousseau and I talked in a small workroom at a school. And he had to interrupt our interview, because he said he needed to help with a transition. I didn't know what that meant, but I followed him into the hallway. And about 30 kids walked single-file line, completely silently, out of their classroom, down the hall, down three flights of stairs, to lunch. This is what that sounds like.

[CLAP]

30 or so 11- and 12-year-old children are streaming past me, down the stairs, single-file. No arms are flapping, no mouths are open, no one is tripping or falling, all the way to the cafeteria.

Chana Joffe-walt
That was a pretty silent line.

Rousseau Mieze
Yeah, well, somebody earned a demerit for talking in that line.

Chana Joffe-walt
Somebody earned a demerit just now?

Rousseau Mieze
From me, yeah. For talking.

Chana Joffe-walt
I did not hear any talking.

I listened back to try to find the infraction. And I think it must be this.

Rousseau Mieze
[INAUDIBLE] demerit for talking.

Chana Joffe-walt
Yeah. That creepy feeling Rousseau had watching the kids at the rest stop, I had that feeling. And it was super confusing, because Rousseau had just spent an hour telling me about these eye-opening experiences he'd had seeing kids laugh and Barack O-comma and how he could never stay quiet as a kid.

So we talked about this for a while. And he says he's ambivalent about how controlling his school was, about all the ways his school today is a lot like the school he attended as a kid. But the longer he teaches, he says, the better he understands a thing that he did not get as a kid about why his teachers were so harsh. And that is that they were scared.

They were scared of losing control of the class. He knew that. That part was obvious to him even when he was a teenager. But what he didn't realize at the time was they were also scared for him. He knows this now, because he is a teacher of mostly poor, mostly black students, like he was. And he feels this for his students.

He's afraid for their well-being. He's afraid of the odds they will not graduate. He's afraid they won't get to college, afraid they'll get suspended or arrested for horsing around or being rowdy at the wrong place at the wrong time. So Rousseau finds himself saying things teachers said to him. And it's like when you're a parent and you hear your mother's voice coming out of your mouth, and you know what you are saying is such a worthless thing to say to a child, but you say it anyway.

Rousseau Mieze
Do you not get why I'm on this level? Let me get you on the level that I'm on. This is why I'm freaking out right now. I'm so worried, because I look at them, and I see myself, or I see my friends. You know, some of those people are in prison right now.

Chana Joffe-walt
Rousseau wants to be able to loosen his grip some as a teacher, allow kids more freedom. He's trying to do that. He takes tiny steps. But he says his fear gets in the way.

Act Three. The Talking Cure.

Ira Glass
Act Three, "The Talking Cure." So after the Texas numbers came out, and then more studies and punishments in schools, lots of educators and policymakers became convinced that a lot of the discipline that schools administer is not working, especially suspensions. So if you don't want to suspend kids, what do you do instead?

Well, one alternative that's talked about a lot, that the Obama administration and others are pushing for schools, is something called restorative justice. Now, the model for this comes from the criminal justice system, where offenders and victims will sit down in a mediation, and they basically try to talk it out and find a way to restore the harm done by the crime. That's why it's restorative.

So if this is the answer for schools, we wanted to see what it looks like when you try that in a school setting. Chana spent last spring semester at a public school called Lyons Community School in Brooklyn. It's a small middle and high school founded nearly eight years ago to attempt this approach with kids.

Just a quick note, the kids in this story are minors, and some of the names have been changed. Also, if you're listening to this on the internet or on podcast, there is cursing that we have not beeped in what you're about to hear. If you prefer a beeped version of our program, you can get it at our website, thisamericanlife.org. OK, here's Chana.

Chana Joffe-walt
I was popular at Lyons. It was a problem. Kids would see me walking around with my microphone, international symbol that someone is about to be made famous. And there'd be a scramble.

Male Student 1
Is this an interview?

Chana Joffe-walt
Some very quick process of natural selection would take place, a dozen kids would get pushed aside, and I'd be left standing with the champions.

Chana Joffe-walt
So you guys are both what grade at Lyons?

Students 1 And 2
Ninth.

Chana Joffe-walt
How do you like it?

Students 1 And 2
It's good.

Chana Joffe-walt
Are you going to say everything at the same time?

Students 1 And 2
No. Stop!

Chana Joffe-walt
You guys both started this year?

Students 1 And 2
Yeah.

Chana Joffe-walt
Having to move a conversation like this into an interview about restorative justice was a little bit of a bummer. Kids at Lyons don't necessarily know that term, nor do they want to talk about it. But when you ask them what their school is like, they have a lot to say about that, mostly what it feels like here. The teachers listen to you. And we have a voice.

Student 1
In my old middle school, they would just suspend us and whatever, call it a day. But at Lyons, we talk about the problem and stuff like that.

Student 2
I had one little altercation, but me and the girl are friends now.

Student 1
Because we all talked about the situation. It was stupid. After the fight, we all got in a circle, and we just talked about the situation.

Chana Joffe-walt
Circles. That's a big thing here. They sit in circles after a fight. Circles are where conflict is resolved, consequences are discussed, feelings are shared. The kids at Lyons get the message that talking is how you are successful.

A beefy ninth grader named Alex, with an Afro and dimples, walked me through, in detail, how he calms himself down when he gets frustrated in class. And then he told me, "Lyons is what made me." I ask him what he means by that.

Alex
I wouldn't think I would talk to you now how I'm talking to you.

Chana Joffe-walt
What do you mean, the way that you're talking to me now?

Alex
Like so friendly, like I could keep on talking and talking. If I would have never been at Lyons, I probably would have never been comfortable talking to you.

Chana Joffe-walt
You wouldn't even be sitting here with me.

Alex
No.

Chana Joffe-walt
You just would have walked away when I asked to talk to you.

Alex
I probably would have, yeah.

Chana Joffe-walt
Later, Alex told me, "I wouldn't have walked away nicely, either." His teachers confirmed this.

All this talking at Lyons can just look like total chaos. There are kids in the hallway at Lyons all the time, there are fights, there's random screaming in between classes. Rousseau's charter school had zero tolerance. Lyons has a tolerance for disruption that rivals a paintball arena.

One day, I found a teacher and dean trying to game out how to approach a student who told a female teacher to suck his dick. The kid said this in class and then walked out.

Chana Joffe-walt
Were you mad? Like mad at him?

Female Teacher 3
I just feel so bad for him, that he can't control himself. Why is he yelling at me? I've only ever been on his side. What is up with that? It just makes me so sad. I don't really have it in me to get mad at him about it.

Chana Joffe-walt
Even though he's telling you, "Suck my dick?"

Female Teacher 3
Well, that was just like a performance. I really didn't take it personally. I mean, it was really just kind of like--

Male Teacher 4
Like out of the probably about 100 times somebody's told me to suck their dick, I don't think they ever meant it personally toward me.

Chana Joffe-walt
That's happened to you 100 times?

Male Teacher 4
Probably.

These two teachers talk about what it means that the student said those words for an hour. They then speak with the student for another hour, the student and his mom, the student and other students, the student one-on-one again. It is a thorough investigation into the meaning and effect of the words "Suck my dick" on the kid, on the teacher, and on the class.

But that's kind of the idea, that kids are a long-term project, and over time, angry, hard kids become people who can explain themselves. At Lyons, they call this transformation "being Lyonized." The assistant principal was telling me about this, about how kids get Lyonized.

And a ninth grader named Nelson happened to be just sitting with us. So she said, "Like Nelson. In sixth grade--"

Female Assistant Principal
He was constantly talking, constantly throwing things, constantly getting kicked out of class, constantly.

Chana Joffe-walt
Nelson is not squirming or grimacing listening to this. The feeling is more of a loving parent teasing a grown child about what an awful teenager he was. But of course, what's so remarkable is Nelson is still a teenager. And this is not his parent. It's his principal.

Female Assistant Principal
You didn't make it through a class, rarely, even when I had you in small group in sixth grade. It was rough.

Chana Joffe-walt
Is that true?

Nelson
Some of it.

Female Assistant Principal
You remember. It's not like you don't remember.

Nelson
Not in that small group. The small group, I wasn't bad.

Female Assistant Principal
That's not true. That's not true. You have selective memory. It's not true.

Chana Joffe-walt
Nelson tells me, "Just ask Espy what I was like in sixth grade." Espy is Dan Espinoza, a dean at the school.

Dan Espinoza
Oh, god. As a sixth grader, he was a very, very angry kid. And even through most of his middle school, he'd be a kid that would just wander the halls for hours on end. No one could talk to him. No one could stop him-- don't touch me, get off me. He would be like, "These f-in' deans. He would always say that.

Chana Joffe-walt
One day, a girl said something nasty to Nelson, and he started screaming at her and then chasing her out of the classroom.

Dan Espinoza
Espy stood by the door so Nelson couldn't run after her. And he looked at me, and he was like, "Dan, I swear to god, I'm about to punch you in the groin right now"-- he said that to me-- "if you don't let go of the door." So I put my foot in the door so that he couldn't open it. And he knew it, and he stopped it at my foot, and then he just pulled harder. And I was--

Chana Joffe-walt
What happened?

Dan Espinoza
It hit me right in the face.

Chana Joffe-walt
When I asked him how hard, Espy said, "It didn't break my jaw or anything." So that was sixth grade. Nelson is in ninth grade now, Lyonized.

Dan Espinoza
I mean, I could tell Nelson, "Nelson, I love you." He'll be like, "I love you, too." And it's just a very good--

Chana Joffe-walt
Oh, really?

Dan Espinoza
Yeah. It's a very positive relationship at this point. I really don't worry about Nelson. I don't worry. I think he's going to be OK.

Chana Joffe-walt
Schools, like any institution, I guess, tend to attract believers, some more fervent than others. But Lyons is a building of believers. This is the way to do things, and it's the right way.

Which is why I want to tell you about what happened on May 7 last spring, something that threatened to reverse years of progress with Nelson and had lots of teachers in the school questioning what they're doing here. On May 7, two teachers named Chelsea and Jesse took a group of ninth graders on a field trip. It was an art class. They were going to Manhattan to look at public art. And even on the walk to the train, kids were noticing public artwork.

Jesse
It was a beautiful day. We got on the train. Everything was pleasant and calm. Chelsea's at one door. I'm at the other. Kids are standing in the aisle. Most of the seats were taken when we got on.

Chelsea
I remember standing with a group of kids around me. And we were all just kind of chatting, who they're dating or just talking about life. Everything seemed so calm. I think we're on the train for two stops, and the train doors open. And someone comes from behind Nelson. So Nelson is standing at the middle pole of the train. And someone pushes past him, kind of shoulders him out of the way, and steps off the train.

And Nelson responds by saying, "Say excuse me." And the man now, who's outside of the train, turns around and starts cursing at Nelson. I don't remember exactly what he said, something like, who the fuck are you, or, shut the fuck up, or something very aggressive, very unnecessary.

Nelson didn't say it in a nice way. He was just like, "Say excuse me." Definitely not within his place to be speaking to an older man that way, but still, not horrible. Chelsea says the man was big, big enough that she wouldn't have messed with him and big enough that, Nelson says, when he bumped into him, it was a real shove.

Nelson
It's rude people on the train. They'll just bump into you without saying excuse me or sorry. I told him, "Say excuse me. You could have said excuse me."

Chana Joffe-walt
And then he said something right back?

Nelson
Said, "Fuck you." I said, "Fuck you, too."

Chana Joffe-walt
There are a lot of versions of what happened next. Some students say the guy reached to grab Nelson, to hit him. Some of them say the guy just stepped forward. Teachers and students, everyone, says, at that point, the kids, a large group of them, moved in on the man.

Chelsea
It was kind of like slow motion. And I could see a volcano erupting. And I just immediately put my arms across the door, because he was outside, and they were inside. And I wanted to keep them inside, and I wanted to keep him outside.

The doors were going to close soon. They're just yelling. They can yell, and then we'll move on.

Chana Joffe-walt
And Chelsea put her arms across the doors to keep the kids behind her inside the train. But for some reason, the doors did not close. The train did not move.

Chelsea
It definitely escalated very quickly. They were trying to hit him over me. They threw a bottle. Somebody spit. I mean, it was really gross.

Chana Joffe-walt
Jesse, meanwhile, the other teacher, was at the other end of the train car. So he couldn't see what was going on. But he stepped out onto the platform, and he sees this man there, screaming.

Jesse
And Chelsea is between him and the students. It appeared that he was reaching over, trying to grab a student. And he's saying something like, I want this fucking kid, or, give me this fucking kid, something like that.

So I was really concerned that he was mentally unstable. And so I ran. I actually sort of-- so I slipped myself between him and Chelsea.

Chelsea
I was facing him. And so I actually saw him reach into his pocket. And I got really-- I was like, oh, my god. Does this guy have some sort of weapon?

Jesse
I actually put my hands on his chest to push him away. And right when I did that, we locked eyes, and he said, "I'm a cop. I'm a cop. I'm a cop."

Chana Joffe-walt
When I asked the kids about this moment later, a bunch of them told me the whole thing was so confusing until right then. The whole time, they were wondering, what's this random guy doing starting with us? And then, when they found out he's a cop, it was like, oh, that's why he's acting like that.

But Jesse and Chelsea both said this is where they got confused. The man made more sense to them as a crazy guy than as an officer, a plainclothes officer, who was now standing on a subway platform with his badge saying he got hit, and he wanted everyone off the train.

Jesse
Yeah, he's like, give me this kid, I want that one, give me the tall one, the short one, who were huddled on the platform. He's picking-- he had one student and was asking for more.

Chelsea
He was very, very, very angry. You know when someone's so angry that spit is coming out of their mouth? Yeah. When he was talking to us and talking to the kids, he was filled with fury.

Chana Joffe-walt
Jesse says the cop pulled aside Nelson, Alex-- that kid who told me Lyons made him capable of talking to me-- and a boy named Kamani. Jesse tried to stay close to the group.

Jesse
I'm saying, "Wait, why do you want them?" And at some point in there, I made it clear. I said, "I'm their teacher. They're with me on a class trip. We need to talk about this."

And he's saying, "I'm going to get six more officers here in a second." And he really did. He called, and there were a bunch more plainclothes officers there really quickly.

Chana Joffe-walt
Jesse pressed on. And the more he recounted this to me, I realized, oh, he's trying to do restorative justice with the guy. He was in teacher mode. He's got 25 of his students standing before him. So without thinking, he does what he knows how to do.

Jesse
You know, let's talk about this. There must be a way we can work this out. You don't have to arrest them. I have a whole class here.

Chana Joffe-walt
And you thought, I just need to explain to him what's going on.

Jesse
Yeah, if I could explain to him, we're on a class trip, and whatever happened must have been some big misunderstanding. Maybe he didn't know you were a cop. Maybe you shouldn't have cursed at him right away. Maybe he shouldn't have said, "Say excuse me," with that particular tone. And if I can help you two see that right now, then everything can be OK. And he wasn't trying to hear any of that.

Chana Joffe-walt
What was he saying?

Jesse
He actually then threatened me and said that, if I don't get away, that he was going to arrest me.

Chana Joffe-walt
Restorative justice, meet plain old criminal justice. The cop was not about to sit in a circle. He was going to make some arrests.

And the kids geared into action. They shot video, started calling mothers and aunts and girlfriends. Someone made sure to get their backpacks.

Nelson's classmate Brianna got Nelson's phone out of his pocket while he was handcuffed. I asked Brianna how she knew to do that when someone was arrested. She was quiet for a couple seconds, like she was trying to figure out what exactly I meant by that question. And then her face cleared up, and she said, oh, I live here. I live in Brooklyn.

Jesse
I immediately got the sense that seeing their friends in handcuffs was nothing new to them at all. And that's a really scary thought. And it's something that I know, but to see it in that moment where it's so clear no one is shocked.

Chana Joffe-walt
About what's happening right there.

Jesse
Yeah. People are angry, but no one is surprised. And seeing how normal it is for some kids is, yeah, that's scary.

Chana Joffe-walt
The cop arrested Nelson and Kamani. The rest of the kids watched. Nelson was charged with disorderly conduct. Kamani was charged with a felony for assaulting an officer.

The NYPD declined multiple requests for an interview or any kind of response. And the officer-- his name is Guillermo Lozano-- would not talk to me. He also didn't show up for Nelson's court dates. He did provide the courts with a written statement that says, after a heated verbal exchange with Nelson, the officer identified himself. Kamani, the statement says, then punched him in the right eye and yelled, "Fuck that."

Kamani denies this. But in court, he took a plea deal. All of the witnesses I spoke with say the cop did not identify himself until after the scuffle. Two people said, at that point, he did appear to have a mark on his face. Nelson and Kamani were booked and spent the night in jail. They were both 16.

Nelson
Everybody's in there for different stuff. So at that point, you just feel like you've just got to watch over yourself, because there's dangerous people in there. You've just got to be cool.

Chana Joffe-walt
Was this other kids or grownups?

Nelson
Grownups. To me, they was a little crazy, because they're just doing random shit and crazy stuff.

Chana Joffe-walt
Like what?

Nelson
Crazy stuff, like grown people getting caught with guns and stuff. It's just weird, because you're just looking at them like, damn. I didn't sleep.

Chana Joffe-walt
Yeah, it seems like it'd be hard to sleep.

Nelson
I was up the whole night.

Chana Joffe-walt
Did you just sit up the whole night?

Nelson
I had my hoodie over my head, just thinking.

Chana Joffe-walt
Were you scared?

Nelson
Not really. I kind of was, but I wasn't.

Chana Joffe-walt
I asked Nelson what he was thinking about all night.

Nelson
If he was a cop, why'd he tell me fuck you? Because he could have said something else if he's that smart enough to be a cop.

Chana Joffe-walt
Like what?

Nelson
I don't know. Like, sorry, my fault. It just made no sense. He's a grown-ass man, and I'm a little kid. He should have just kept going.

Chana Joffe-walt
When Nelson got out the next morning, he came straight to school. He said he wanted to let his teachers know he was OK.

The principal of Lyons, Taeko Onishi, sends out a weekly email to staff. And that week, it described the arrests and said, "There's an impending court case, so I won't get into too much detail. But it was one of those cases of a cop undercover, responding completely inappropriately to our students, our students then responding inappropriately back. Clearly, the cop was in the wrong. But equally clearly, many of our students really struggle to make the best of choices when faced with an emotionally charged situation."

Of course, Lyons staff discussed the incident exhaustively.

Jesse
I was sick. It's like your worst nightmare. Assaulting an officer sounds so bad.

Chana Joffe-walt
Espy, the dean who tells Nelson he loves him, could not stop imagining Nelson in jail. He imagined Nelson getting his prints taken, standing before a judge, seeing himself as a criminal. And Espy played out the alternate future he could now see for Nelson. Basically, he had the same moment Tunette had with JJ, seeing a path laid out before him, seeing him targeted by strangers who don't see him for who he is. It made Espy furious.

But other teachers at Lyons took the news of the arrests differently. Kamani's English teacher, Cindy Black, said she kept thinking about all the times Kamani acted out in her class, blew up, threw books on the floor. And she kept wondering, is what we're doing working for the kids?

Cindy Black
And so when I first heard about what had happened, my immediate reaction was, oh, no. It's our fault. We've allowed him to get away with too much. We should have been suspending him more.

We should have been more black and white. We shouldn't have turned away when he did these outrageous things. We should have held him more accountable.

And we didn't do any of that stuff. And so it's our fault he's done something now. He spent the night in jail. It's because of us. It's because of me.

Chana Joffe-walt
Here's Chelsea.

Chelsea
Because maybe if we were a different kind of school, they would not have acted that way on a trip. I don't know if kids would have felt the freedom to act that way.

Chana Joffe-walt
Freedom to say "excuse me" to a stranger in a rude tone, to throw stuff, and to talk back. It seemed like the cop saw them as rowdy or threatening. What if they'd been more like Rousseau's students, quiet and in uniforms, doing homework? Maybe this whole thing could've been avoided.

But Espy reminded everyone, wait, the cop said, "Fuck you." Kamani only got involved when the cop started with Nelson. We're going to tell them he should have held back?

Jesse
Are you kidding me? When his friend is getting pulled by a plainclothed guy? How do you-- I just don't-- because I know, if I was there, I would be arrested, because if someone's grabbing Nelson and it's just a guy, I'm going to-- so I would have been arrested.

And this guy clearly had a-- everybody around said Nelson said, "You could say excuse me." That's the first thing Nelson said, when the first thing the guy says is, "Fuck you." And this is a kid who we're trying to teach, be patient, don't confront somebody. And I thought he did a pretty good job. But once you say, "Fuck you," to Nelson, the restorative justice doesn't work beyond that point.

Chana Joffe-walt
Still, restorative justice is what the school does. So after Jesse and Chelsea got the rest of the class back to school, they set them down in a circle. Here's Alex.

Alex
Just talking about what happened at that day and what we could have did to stop it.

Chana Joffe-walt
What could you guys have done to stop it?

Alex
I don't know. We can't stop something like that. The police officer just took them for no reason. We can't stop-- we can't change his mind as Jesse tried to change his mind. He didn't want to change his mind.

Chana Joffe-walt
So your circle was about what you could do to stop it, but you felt like there was nothing that you could do to stop it?

Alex
Yeah. I didn't really feel like telling nobody. So I didn't really feel like talking about it.

Chana Joffe-walt
In other words, nothing that we could do, nothing you teachers can do, would have stopped that. I heard this from a lot of kids, the feeling that your funky little system is cool when we're in school and all, but don't try and take it and apply it to our world. You're in over your head.

If talking in circles are not the way the world does things, then Lyons is failing to prepare kids for the world they live in. And if they're not preparing kids for the world they live in, they're not doing their job, right? Isn't that their job? Is that their job?

This is the question I keep coming back to, thinking about all these stories. It's the same question Rousseau, at his no-excuses charter school, is asking.

What is the point of punishment in school? Is it to teach self-control? To get kids to be quiet so learning can happen? To prepare children to function as grownups in the world? To teach them how to avoid being arrested? If you want to know, is this working for the kids, you have to know what you're going for, right?

Every year, teachers have 30 or 100 students. A lot of those kids will be disciplined. And getting it wrong, even once, can be haunting. For example, remember Christopher, the kid who ran around the classroom with his teacher's stapler and Post-It notes coming out of his pockets everywhere? I tried to track Christopher down. I thought it might be interesting to hear what he remembered of the stapler, if he remembered his teacher.

And I found him, just last month in a Manhattan courthouse. He was being sentenced to six months at Rikers Island for burglary. Christopher's seventh-grade teacher did not cause that. But when I told Ms. Furr, she got really quiet, ended our call kind of abruptly, and then wrote me this.

"I was so heartbroken to hear the news about Christopher's recent trouble. All the times I talked about behavior with him, I wish I would have talked about how quick that he was at math and how much I liked to hear him read out loud. If you do speak to him, please tell him I'm glad to help in any way possible."

Katie Furr has no idea if those things would have made any difference, and I don't either. And I wasn't able to reach the one person who might have something to say about that, because he has been removed from the community, something he's gone through many times before, starting at least as early as seventh grade.

I run this mother.

Ira Glass
I'm Ira Glass. Back next week with more stories of This American Life.

OK. First, a warning. I am going to talk about math. Don't worry, it won't be bad. 1644, a monk named Marin Mersenne gets obsessed for a while with prime numbers. You remember prime numbers? They're like the atoms of math, indivisible. They cannot be divided by any other number than themselves. So 3 is a prime number. You can only divide it by 3. Versus 4, which you can divide by 2, and you can get 2. Remember? OK. So Mersenne.

Paul Hoffman
So he had a formula that he thought could predict prime numbers, OK?

Ira Glass
This is Paul Hoffman, who wrote about this in his book The Man Who Loved Only Numbers. He says that mathematicians had been searching for a formula like this to find prime numbers for nearly 2,000 years at that point.

Paul Hoffman
Euclid, way, way back, 2,300 years ago, had proved that there's an infinite number of prime numbers. But he gave no formula for how to find them. I mean, they're easy at small numbers. We can do the math in our head. 7's prime. Nothing divides into it. 11's prime. If I give you a really big number, now you're going to have to start calculating, OK? So this monk came up with a formula.

Ira Glass
Mersenne creates this formula. And he uses it to spit out prime numbers. And one of the prime numbers that he said that he discovered was-- and this is going to sound a little bit technical-- 2 raised to the 67th power-- that is, 2 times 2 times 2 times 2, 67 times-- minus 1. And if that was confusing, all you need to know is this number of Mersenne's, 2 raised to the 67th minus 1, was famous among mathematicians.

Paul Hoffman
That's how his paper ended. He said it was a prime number. This is 1644. So 250 years later, we're into the 20th century. I think it's 1903. And you have this mathematician that shows up at a mathematical conference--

Ira Glass
And who is this? What is the conference? Where are we?

Paul Hoffman
It's here in the United States. His name is Frank Nelson Cole. And he gave his talk a very unassuming title. He titled his talk "On the Factorization of Large Numbers." And he went to a blackboard. And he wrote, 2 to the 67th minus 1--

Ira Glass
Wait, wait. Does he say anything?

Paul Hoffman
He says nothing. He says not a word.

Ira Glass
He just walks over to the blackboard and just, like--

Paul Hoffman
He writes that. And of course, everybody in the audience knows that that's the famous Mersenne prime. And he writes, equals, and then he writes out a 21-digit number--

Ira Glass
Oh, in other words, when you take 2 and then multiply it by 2 67 times, and then subtract 1, that is this number, 21 digits long. OK.

Paul Hoffman
Exactly, exactly. Equals this number. Then he moved over to a blank piece of blackboard. And he wrote down two numbers. One is a nine-digit number, times a 12-digit number. He writes those two numbers out.

Ira Glass
OK, so that's two numbers that were sitting there on the board, multiplication problem, and?

Paul Hoffman
And then he did the multiplication, just like the way they taught us back in second grade to do it. 7 times 1, he put down the 7. He went through the whole steps--

Ira Glass
Just long multiplication. Does he say anything?

Paul Hoffman
Says not a word. Everybody sits there silently.

Ira Glass
Now, remember, the whole idea of a prime number is you should not be able to take two numbers, and then multiply them together and get a prime number as a result. It's supposed to be indivisible. If you multiplied two numbers together and you got this 21-digit number as a result, then that 21-digit number is not prime. And if Mersenne thought it was prime-- which he did-- his formula supposedly spits out prime numbers, this one of them, then his formula, 250 years old, is just wrong.

So, picture it. There's Frank Nelson Cole at the blackboard, slowly doing long multiplication, these two huge numbers. It takes a while. They're big numbers. It takes minutes, as this room full of mathematicians just watches him, lots of them, I'm sure, scrutinizing him for any math errors. He still has not said a word. And then, he gets to his result.

Paul Hoffman
And indeed, it ends up being that 21-digit number. Now, the whole place erupts into applause. Legend has it, this is the first time at a math conference that people got up and applauded. And he just returns to his seat without a word.

And then later, someone asked him, "How long did it actually take you to figure out that Mersenne was wrong, that indeed this number has two factors?" And he said that he spent three years of Sundays working on this.

Ira Glass
Three years of Sundays. Paul says these three years of Sundays were probably spent solving the problem by trying every possible solution-- dividing that huge number, 2 to the 67th power minus 1, by one number and then the next number and then the next. Three years of Sundays is 156 Sundays. For 155 of them, Frank Nelson Cole failed. Until finally, on the 156th Sunday, Frank Nelson Cole found a number that would divide it evenly, which, Paul says, is par for the course.

Paul Hoffman
That's what science is about. It's real people banging their heads against walls and years of false starts. That's the other thing. We don't talk about the researcher who spent two years trying to find what this gene did and then gave up, or spent three years trying to find a planet outside the solar system and gave up, and someone else eventually did. It's more a combination of insight and hard work, because--

Ira Glass
Failure.

Paul Hoffman
And failure. Because people who think outside the box and achieve things outside the box often entertain a lot of wacky ideas that don't turn out to be true in the science world. Isaac Newton had lots of weird ideas. Charles Darwin had weird ideas. They happened to be right about what they're known for. Isaac Newton got a little interested in ghosts and all sorts of occult stuff.

Ira Glass
Really?

Paul Hoffman
Yeah.

Ira Glass
Wait, wait. And did he believe in ghosts, or did he just think, we gotta investigate this. Maybe there's some data here.

Paul Hoffman
No, he started believing in them. He--

Ira Glass
Isaac Newton?

Paul Hoffman
Yeah.

Ira Glass
Wow.

Paul Hoffman
So they're known for their out-of-the-box thinking on something that turns out to be true and is wonderful. But they've also entertained a lot of other stuff.

Ira Glass
Well, today on our radio program, we have two stories of people who face impossible-seeming situations. And in each of those stories, it's like a bad action film. These two people each decide that the stakes are high enough that their best shot is to try something crazy, so crazy it just might work. The first story is about a scientist. The second story is about somebody employing this technique in his personal life, which is really something to see. From WBEZ Chicago, it's This American Life, distributed by Public Radio International. I am hoping that all this sounds so crazy you just might stay with us.

Act One. Mr. Holland's Opus.

Ira Glass
Act One, Mr. Holland's Opus. OK, true story. A guy goes to college on a music scholarship. And then afterwards, he ends up going into science. And he becomes a cancer researcher. His name is Jon Brody. And 19 years after graduating, Jon is invited back to his old college to give a talk about his work. And the speech he gives is mainly about how important it's been in his research to think outside the box, to use an overused phrase. To think outside the box, to be ready to turn away from what's familiar and try some new idea.

And then after his speech, Jon is approached by his old orchestra teacher, a guy named Anthony Holland. And Professor Holland, to Jon's great surprise, says, "Speaking of thinking outside the box, I've actually been working on an experiment for a few years that I'd like to show you. Come look at this video. I think you'll find it very interesting." So what could Jon do? He'd just actually given a whole talk about keeping an open mind.

What resulted from this was the kind of scientific collaboration that almost never, ever happens-- a serious cancer researcher teaming up with an amateur to try to make a breakthrough. Gabriel Rhodes is a documentary filmmaker. And he's been following the story from the beginning, back when Jon watched that video. Here's Gabriel.

Gabriel Rhodes
I've seen the video that Anthony, the orchestra teacher, showed Jon. And it amazed me. I saw single-cell organisms, basically round and oblong and pear-shaped blobs, swimming around under a microscope. Anthony narrates this as he goes along. And suddenly, the cells stop and just self-destruct.

Anthony Holland
Look what happened, just now. He suddenly and dramatically disintegrated--

Gabriel Rhodes
Some burst into tiny fragments. And some look like a plastic bag that's been punctured, and their contents leak out. As Anthony explained to Jon, the theory behind what he was doing was simple. You know how a singer, if they hit the right frequency, can shatter a crystal glass? Well, Anthony was basically doing the same thing, directing specific frequencies at microorganisms, like bacteria and protozoa, to try and shatter them. And after a year and a half of experimentation, suddenly, it worked.

So Anthony showed this to Jon. And he and Jon each remember the conversation that followed a little differently, in a way that says a lot about their later collaboration. Anthony's version was entirely optimistic.

Anthony Holland
He immediately jumped right to the main thing that I was interested in. And he just said, "Do you think you can shatter cancer cells like that?"

Gabriel Rhodes
And here's Jon.

Jonathan Brody
You know, when I first heard about it, it's in the arena of UFOs, for sure. He was putting words in my mouth already. He was saying things like, "Do you think this would work?" And I would say, "Well, it's a possibility, and I'm willing to try anything." And so Anthony would, in his voice, he would would say, "So you're saying that I could maybe cure cancer." And I was like, "Well, so could the oboe player downstairs."

Gabriel Rhodes
But Jon was willing to talk more, in part, because he's so frustrated with cancer research. He thinks it's stalled. Lots of people going over the same familiar ideas, endlessly refining the same concepts, because the familiar is more likely to get funded.

Jonathan Brody
I do think it's much like being out in Hollywood, where you might go out to Hollywood thinking that you're going to be Kafka. And you might end up writing the worst, hackiest sitcom in the world, because you want to survive. So what happens in this country when the same thing happens with science?

Gabriel Rhodes
I've known Jon Brody for 20 years. He's a good friend of mine. And before this encounter, Anthony was just a professor who drove him really hard, back when he went to college on a percussion scholarship. They weren't close or anything. But Jon definitely remembered Professor Holland as he'd always known him.

Jonathan Brody
He probably wouldn't say this, but I sort of remember him as-- I think he was disappointed in me as a musician in the orchestra, because I remember him wanting to have, like, extra sessions with me. And I think when we had a guest composer come in, I hate to say it, I think he relegated me to playing the triangle. And I'm not kidding. I seriously remember having to count, like, 67 bars to hit that one quarter note on the triangle.

Gabriel Rhodes
So when Anthony came up to him after his speech, Jon was flattered that this teacher he'd always respected was interested in his work. They started emailing back and forth about Anthony's video and his experiments, until finally, Jon decided that he couldn't tell whether Anthony had something serious that could be researched unless he drove up to see him. So he went. And he invited me along just as a fun road trip. And why not film the conversation while I'm there?

Anthony Holland
Is there enough light? I'm worried about the light.

Jonathan Brody
Oh, yeah.

Gabriel Rhodes
We're up as Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, where Anthony teaches. Anthony's in his early '50s, but he's got a boyish vibe. He bounces a little when he walks. Full head of brown hair, goatee, glasses, corduroys. Your basic professor. Jon's in his late '30s, balding but in that stylish, close-cropped way. He stays in shape, even though he works like a maniac.

And over the course of their long conversation, Jon was surprised and impressed by how much Anthony knew, how much he'd read, how dogged he'd been in his experiments. And one thing in particular caught Jon's attention. In Anthony's experiments, particular frequencies seemed to target particular organisms and left others untouched, meaning there might be frequencies that could destroy cancer cells while leaving normal, healthy cells alone-- a potential solution, Jon said, to the biggest problem with most cancer treatments.

Jonathan Brody
So if we can find a frequency specific to cancer cells, we could put someone in a room, and you hit that frequency, and it's not affecting normal cells. I mean, that's the actual perfect paradigm in which to treat someone for this disease. Because what kills a patient is not the primary tumor. It's the tumors that have left the site and gone off into neighborhoods that the surgeon can't take out. So if you could walk into a room and you can get completely zapped, like a complete CAT scan--

Anthony Holland
Right. And it only hits the cancer. It doesn't hurt healthy cells. Yeah, that would be the--

Jonathan Brody
Home run.

Anthony Holland
That's the dream.

Jonathan Brody
Yeah.

Gabriel Rhodes
That's the dream, because chemotherapy and radiation are so flawed. Both devastate healthy cells. Anthony's machine works by pulsing the cells with electromagnetic waves at specific frequencies. And there are other scientists out there - published in peer-reviewed journals - who are also using electromagnetic waves to attack cancer cells. There's an FDA clinical trial going on right now using this method.

The whole field is still very new, just a handful of people - and Anthony's system is different from others - but using electromagnetic waves to target cancer cells isn't just a fantasy dreamed up by a music professor. Then Jon asked Anthony how he'd gotten into these experiments in the first place.

Anthony Holland
I read an interesting book called Lost Science. And I'm very interested in hidden information, in secret stuff we're not supposed to know and things maybe that were known a long time ago or forgotten or something.

And in that book-- now this is where it probably gets very kind of controversial-- but I read about a guy named Royal Raymond Rife. And the book says that in the 1930s, he built an electromagnetic frequency device, a radio frequency device, which cured cancer. I got the device. I developed a special, custom-built frequency synthesis program, because that's what I teach, digital audio synthesis. And I've been studying sound and physics and acoustics for a long time. And I began to run frequencies through this device.

Gabriel Rhodes
Now, Royal Rife, for lots of people who have even heard of him, is a name synonymous with bogus cancer cures. He was an inventor in the 1930s. And the legend is that he cured a bunch of people with cancer using an electromagnetic wave device before he was destroyed by a greedy, mainstream medical establishment. It's a staple of conspiracy theory websites. Google him. He's everywhere. If Jon wanted out of the box, Anthony and the Rife machine were way outside.

And Jon and Anthony were just an unlikely pair. Jon was the head of his own lab by the age of 40. He gets hundreds of thousands of dollars from the National Institutes of Health and other very mainstream medical research organizations. Anthony, meanwhile, is a composer, electronics whiz, a self-taught expert in several fields, and a deep skeptic of all things mainstream, especially in medicine. He pulled me aside more than once to warn me I'd better be careful, my life might be in danger. Because big pharmaceutical companies would try to hush up any story about a possible cancer treatment alternative.

But they decided to work together. And it was just as much a personal decision as anything else. Each of them saw something in the other. They liked each other.

And Jon thought, who cares where the electromagnetic wave theory came from? It's a potentially game-changing treatment. Why not at least test it? So he invited Anthony to come down to his lab in Philadelphia with the device. And they agreed to keep everything as low stakes as possible, half-serious, half a lark. Anthony would come for only two weeks. And they'd see what happened.

Anthony Holland
This is the miracle amplifier, the secret weapon.

Gabriel Rhodes
Anthony is in a room at Jon's lab at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, unpacking his equipment. And the plan for the next two weeks is that Anthony will work at night after everyone else leaves, so he isn't taking time or space away from other experiments. And he has to pay his own way. No tax dollars or grant money will be spent on this. Jon will supervise.

So here Anthony is, surrounded by amplifiers, cables, all sorts of equipment, none of which is in special cases or anything. It's all coming out of luggage, wrapped in bubble wrap, and into this room where they do molecular cloning. It's got microscopes, a big medical-grade incubator, a special sterile area called the Tissue Culture Hood. It's high-tech. Jon's watching Anthony assembling his gear.

Jonathan Brody
It looks like you literally made this in your garage.

Gabriel Rhodes
Jon said, "It looks like you literally made this in your garage." To me, the setup looks like it was designed by Dr. Seuss for some sci-fi movie in the '60s. There's some high-tech gear, like a big, glass, helium-filled tube with electrodes that glows pink when it's turned on, and then this whole mess of consumer electronics.

Anthony Holland
This is a power supply that came from an electronics house in Cleveland. And then this little 100-watt magical amp I picked up from some company that sells CB radios to truckers or something on the internet.

Gabriel Rhodes
There's also two laptops. And on one, Anthony's written a program that generates frequencies to send into the device. It sounds like this--

[BEEP]

Anthony Holland
It's not a really fabulous sound. It's kind of ugly and annoying.

Gabriel Rhodes
Yeah. And then a transmitter transposes the frequencies way up out of the audible range.

Anthony Holland
And then, what we'll do is we'll set the cancer cells right here. And with any luck, if we get the right frequency, the cancer cells may in fact start dying.

Gabriel Rhodes
For the next two weeks, Anthony works all night, every night, running experiments, taking cancer cells that have been prepared for him out of the incubator. And he pulses the cells with frequencies for hours, trying one frequency after another. Jon checks in on the experiments every day. There's a lot of trial and error and problems. Some of the equipment blows out and has to be replaced. And Jon and Anthony aren't sure what they've got until Anthony's last day, when Jon comes to look at the latest experiments.

Anthony Holland
Let's see. They're going to be labeled 720.

Gabriel Rhodes
They're sitting in front of a microscope, looking down at pancreatic cancer cells. The cells are in what looks like a tiny plastic egg carton. Jon looks down into the microscope, and he starts to get excited.

Jonathan Brody
This is pretty surprising to me.

Anthony Holland
Really?

Jonathan Brody
Yeah.

Gabriel Rhodes
A huge percentage of the pancreatic cells that Anthony pulsed with his device are dead. They combined the pulsing with a tiny bit of chemo. And of the cancer cells that Anthony pulsed, only 10% are still alive. A separate group of cells that he did not pulse has 60% alive. And this comparison is the key to the whole thing. In any experiment, you have the cells that you treat and the ones that you don't treat, which are called the control group. Comparing the treated cells to the control is the only way you can tell if something's working.

Again, here, only 10% of the pulsed cells survived, versus 60% of the control cells. It's a dramatic result. And Jon gives everything to the lab tech Christina to count up the cells in a precise way, do the quantitative analysis.

Jonathan Brody
I mean, when she quantitates these, we're going to have a beautiful graph.

Anthony Holland
Really?

Jonathan Brody
Yeah. I mean, a beautiful graph.

Gabriel Rhodes
A beautiful graph. That's code for Jon is thrilled. Pancreatic cancer is his specialty. And it's practically invincible, harder to kill than other cancers. So tough that even chemo, which is poison, often barely works at all. Over the last 25 years, the biggest treatment breakthrough only added about four months to a patient's life.

Jon starts going through his mental checklist of potential problems with the experiment. This is what he does when he's excited about new results. And he checks with Anthony about the controls.

Jonathan Brody
That's all you did to these things. And you took these out of the incubator, the others, out? The controls did you take out?

Anthony Holland
No. The controls I left in the incubator. I know I probably should take them out for the six or seven hours that I'm treating them. But, um--

Jonathan Brody
Yeah, I thought you were doing that. That's why, that first day, I was asking you to do that.

Anthony Holland
Right.

Gabriel Rhodes
Jon's expression doesn't change much. But the experiment is now a wash. The cells that Anthony was pulsing sat outside the incubator for hours at a time while he was pulsing them. Therefore, the control plates also had to sit outside the incubator for the exact same amount of time. Otherwise, they don't count as controls.

It was an amateur's mistake. And of course, Anthony is an amateur. But getting the controls exactly right turns out to be one of the hardest parts of any experiment. So even though Anthony's two weeks are up-- he has to leave today-- they've got to do the experiments again.

The first chance Anthony has to go back to Jon's lab is six months later. It's a whole day's drive. He's on a sabbatical, so he can be here for five weeks this time. I visit him about three weeks in.

Anthony Holland
You ask me how it's going. It's like the Tale of Two Cities. It's going really great on one hand, and it's going really badly on the other hand. It's going really great because we have absolute proof-- and we'll see what Jon says later today when we see him. But we're blowing cancer cells away.

Gabriel Rhodes
This is how Anthony sees it, because night after night, he's watching cancer cells die and taking thousands of time-lapse photos and videos as it happens, like the video that he first showed Jon. The problem is, these photos are not absolute proof at all, not to any scientist, not to Jon. Cancer cells die for all kinds of reasons. Absolute proof means only one thing-- counting the cells in the experiments, the treated ones and the control groups, and comparing them. So while Anthony might think they have proof, Jon would never say that.

In these last three weeks, Anthony's had a series of setbacks. Basically, the photos are all he's got from a bunch of experiments that had to be thrown out. But finally, he starts to get incredible results. Jon gave him leukemia cells for the first time. And the pulsing seems to have killed 30% more of the cancer cells compared with the controls.

Jonathan Brody
You're doing something to these. You're doing something here.

Anthony Holland
Well, yeah, I have video.

Jonathan Brody
We can get quantitation on this.

Anthony Holland
Really? Hey, if we can get quantitative numbers out of this, I'll keep hammering these guys.

Gabriel Rhodes
Jon turns to Anthony and starts going through his mental checklist. Again he's excited. He's thinking that maybe, if everything's right, these results are good enough to publish in a paper.

Jonathan Brody
Now Anthony, I'm serious about this. You need to think about, for me, like anything I've done for you, you need to think about, is there any-- these plates just sit out here, and then you bring the other plate in there. And there's nothing different that you do to those plates.

Anthony Holland
Nope.

Jonathan Brody
Except for the--

Anthony Holland
Just electronic pulsing.

Jonathan Brody
Because if we publish this, your name will go first. My name will go last. It's our names on the line. We're married together.

Anthony Holland
Yeah, I understand that.

Jonathan Brody
So our reputation is married.

Anthony Holland
I think I should be a technical footnote at the end, "Thanks to Anthony Holland for assistance."

Jonathan Brody
I think that's absurd.

Anthony Holland
It wouldn't bother me.

Jonathan Brody
That's one of the most absurd comments you've made since I've known you. And you've made a few.

Anthony Holland
That's OK with me. I mean that.

Jonathan Brody
Careful here.

Gabriel Rhodes
A couple days later, I talk to Jon up on the roof of his apartment building. They're still waiting for the numbers, the analysis. But now, they've got both leukemia and pancreatic experiments that they're fired up about.

Jonathan Brody
I mean, they're astounding results and sort of unprecedented. There could be a lot of reasons behind it besides the pulsing. And that's why we need to reproduce it. What makes me nervous and anxious is if I'm truly the only cancer researcher using this apparatus since Royal Rife, because again, that puts even more pressure on me to publish something that's real. And of course, I want it to work. It's potentially something very exciting. But it's still very much up in the air.

Gabriel Rhodes
Anthony's in a very different place.

Anthony Holland
[SINGING] Somewhere over the rainbow.

I kind of feel like that. We're living in Oz right now, because we're doing the impossible. What was Oz all about? Oz was all about, Dorothy goes to a wonderful place where miracles happen. That's where I am, because we're proving the impossible. We're proving that a Rife machine kills cancer. We're not proving. It's been proven. The question is, how much proof can we pile up now for other people? As Jon said, no one's going to believe it. Well, the rest of my life, no matter what anybody says, I know it works.

Gabriel Rhodes
By the end of August, a year since they started this process, Anthony's done two rounds of experiments. And he's about to finish a final round. The plan is for Anthony to reproduce the great leukemia and pancreatic results one more time, with perfect controls, including a special kind of control called a sham. Jon has asked Anthony to start writing up a paper to submit for publication while he's finishing the experiments. And he's more confident about the project than I've ever seen him.

Jonathan Brody
Just to let you know where I'm at, I'm excited about finishing this paper, putting my name on the paper. I'm willing to put my name out there so much that I'll be the senior author, the last author. And I'm willing to send in an NIH grant-- I don't know if we'll get it together-- for October. So this will be a six-page, $250,000 grant to pursue this work with Anthony. And I believe it so much that we're starting to administratively think about it and move this forward.

If these controls work out well, his therapy's working at this stage of the game. And I wouldn't have predicted that. I mean, I know I'm going to get criticism about it. I know they're like, what are you doing? What is this? Do you really believe this stuff? I'm very serious about my reputation. And some scientists don't have an open mind. I'm definitely nervous about that aspect.

Anthony Holland
Hello, Jonathan. How you doing?

Jonathan Brody
I'm doing OK. How are you?

Anthony Holland
Very good.

Gabriel Rhodes
And then, bad news. Really bad news. I'm up at Skidmore with Anthony when Jon calls with the data about the final round of experiments. At first, they talk about the Excel spreadsheet with data from the control experiment called a sham. There was a bit of a strange result there. But the real bad news comes when Jon asks Anthony to open up the PowerPoint presentation and look at the data from the pancreatic experiments.

Anthony Holland
PowerPoint. Let's see, room temperature-- whoa. What is this a PowerPoint of?

Jonathan Brody
Well, the pulsing basically caused the cells to become resistant to the drugs. And they grew better.

Anthony Holland
This is really weird, because it's very opposite of what we saw in previous experiments.

Jonathan Brody
Yeah.

Gabriel Rhodes
It's a disaster. It's a huge setback. It's shocking. The data show that in the plate of treated pancreatic cells, the ones pulsed with electromagnetic waves and given a tiny dose of chemo, 100% of the cancer cells were alive after treatment. Meaning not only did the pulsing not kill any cancer cells, but somehow, the pulsing seemed to protect the cancer cells from being killed by the chemo. Anthony is stunned. He keeps saying the same thing again and again.

Anthony Holland
All the other experiments show completely different results. I don't understand that. It doesn't make any sense to me.

Jonathan Brody
It's a slap in the face, isn't it?

Anthony Holland
Yeah. Yeah.

Jonathan Brody
Yeah. So I'll go through stepwise, OK? Because there's some things we definitely need to discuss here.

Gabriel Rhodes
They talk for 45 minutes, going over every aspect of the experiment. Anthony had used a different microscope this time. Maybe that was a problem. The microscope light that Anthony used when he took time-lapsed photos of the experiments, was the light heating the cells? And the amp for the device had been outputting less power than usual. Maybe some of the components were damaged. But the upshot of these last experiments is different for Jon and Anthony. Anthony sees these results as a fluke, an outlier. The other results still seem valid to him.

Jonathan Brody
But for Jon, there's only one truth. If they want to publish, they've got to do more experiments. Anthony has to reproduce and confirm those great earlier results with controls. For me, doing this for 20-some-odd years or whatever it is, it doesn't surprise me that it's going to be this complicated. But I'm in it for the long haul, as far as the collaboration is, to try to figure this out. And we'll just keep at it, OK?

Anthony Holland
OK.

Gabriel Rhodes
But that wasn't what happened. In fact, for an entire year, Jon wasn't sure what was going on. And neither was I. He offered to go up to Skidmore to set up a lab for Anthony there if he couldn't come back down to Philadelphia. But that didn't happen. And then Anthony became very hard to reach.

And a couple of weeks after Jon talked to Anthony by phone for the first time in several months, I go and see Jon. He's decided to go up to Saratoga the following week to talk to Anthony face to face about the experiment. In the last year, Jon's become more of a skeptic, partly about the device itself, but also about the collaboration with Anthony. Why would Anthony just drop out like this?

Jonathan Brody
If he really believes in it and he really believes those results, let's do it again. If you cured cancer cells, let's do it again. My lab is open. My lab is open. My expertise is open. I'm happy-- you don't want to do it in Philadelphia? Let's do it in Saratoga. Ask him, why hasn't he taken me up on that? Let me ask you a question. If you knew you had something that killed cancer cells, and you believed in it, you really believed in it, you could wait a year to try to prove that because one set of experiments didn't work? I mean, come on.

Gabriel Rhodes
This is one of the big differences between Jon and Anthony, between scientist and non-scientist. For Jon, having a year's worth of work suddenly thrown into question is a normal day at the office. But for Anthony, that's not normal. And it's not OK. The time in Jon's lab was a year of his life, where he felt like Jon kept moving the goal posts.

I felt that way, too, sometimes as I was watching. Jon kept saying he was amazed at what he was seeing and just about convinced. But then he'd wake up in the middle of the night with another experiment or control that he wanted to run. And there was no telling when it would end, which for him, again, is normal. But now, Anthony wants to know, before he starts turning his life upside down again, what will count as proof enough for Jon? How many experiments?

Anthony Holland
So let's say I do three weeks of experiment, and I only concentrate on these leukemia cells. And if I can kill at least 20% every single time, every week, will that do it? Would that be enough? Or do you want to see pancreatic die, or do you want to see-- I mean, what exact buttons do I have to hit?

Gabriel Rhodes
When Jon gets to Saratoga, he and Anthony embrace and smile. And they're clearly glad to see each other. But as soon as they start talking about the experiments, they start arguing. And they don't understand each other. Jon keeps coming back to the same point.

Jonathan Brody
Why can't you accept that we haven't proven anything? In the court of scientific law, we haven't proven anything.

Anthony Holland
But we have very intriguing results.

Jonathan Brody
That's fine. I mean, if you want to leave it at that, you could say that. But there's a big difference between intriguing and promising results and actually showing and demonstrating that something works. There's a huge difference. So 10 years from now, would you still walk around campus and be like, you know what? I killed those cancer cells. I actually did that. I actually proved that this worked. Do you think, deep down, that's the way you feel? That's what I want to know.

Anthony Holland
We're not just talking about the last experiment, right? We're talking about the whole thing. In general? Are you kidding? I would frame this chart showing 43% of the leukemia cells dead. And I would say, we nailed them.

Jonathan Brody
Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question. If you're sitting on the cure for cancer, why aren't we doing the experiments?

Anthony Holland
I can't afford it.

Jonathan Brody
So you're telling me, you're willing to say to the world that you think you have the cure for cancer, but you can't afford it.

Anthony Holland
Yeah.

Gabriel Rhodes
Anthony says he's run out of money. He spent six years, including the time he worked on his own with protozoa, putting his own money into these experiments. Equipment, travel, living expenses while he was at Jon's lab, many, many thousands of dollars. He won't say exactly how much. And then, after he got back from the last round of experiments at Jon's lab, it was like he was looking up from the microscope at his life for the first time in a while.

Anthony Holland
I tell you, I came home from that year, and I just look at the house, and I just see, oh my god, I lost track of what's going on here. We need a new roof on the house. And we've got a huge leak in the bathroom. The plumbing's all screwed up. And I've been making too many sacrifices.

Gabriel Rhodes
Jon doesn't offer to fund another round of experiments. He's got a tight budget. And at this point, like I said, he's not feeling so hopeful about Anthony and his experiment. He's more optimistic about the 30-plus other experiments he's got moving ahead in his lab.

And Anthony refuses to ask for money to proceed. He says that would be rude. But he says he may have a different solution to the money problem. He starts showing Jon his new website for his new nonprofit company, called--

Anthony Holland
Novobiotronics Incorporated, "the future of biotechnology research," and a lot of dramatic statements.

Gabriel Rhodes
Apparently, for the past year, Anthony's been forming this nonprofit company and building the website, which has tabs for all the different research he hopes to do with the device. Not just cancer, but also Lyme disease, malaria. He doesn't get into the malaria or any part of that with Jon. But he does show him the pages and pages where he explains, in detail, the cancer experiments they've done, without mentioning Jon's name or the name of his lab, since he doesn't have permission.

Anthony says his plan is to use the website to raise money so they can continue the experiments. I thought Jon might be angry. Why hadn't Anthony told him that this is what he'd been doing all year? But Jon's reaction is--

Jonathan Brody
This is amazing. I wish that all the students or the graduate students or people or the scientists that believed in what they were doing took this sort of initiative.

Anthony Holland
Wow. That's nice to hear.

Jonathan Brody
I think it's a beautiful website, Anthony. I think it's great. I think my only concern is, again, which is my overall concern of where things are at, is you have to be really careful here, that, really, a trained eye or a trained scientist is going to immediately question the overabundance of data without the controls and without the reproducibility.

Anthony Holland
So let me respond to this idea that intelligent and expert trained scientists, if shown this data, might dismiss it for lack of more information on the controls. And here's where I've been saving the best information for last, for a sort of dramatic and controversial revelation. I've had three important scientists in the field, in the field of cancer research, contact me about my work. They have seen this data. They have seen all of our data.

Gabriel Rhodes
This changes the conversation entirely. Suddenly, Jon's reputation is on the line.

Jonathan Brody
I would never give that data out to another scientist. It wasn't controlled. That's highly inappropriate behavior that you did, that you actually went behind my back and you sent this to other researchers, where I allowed you to use my credibility and my lab to do this work.

Anthony Holland
OK, so here's my response. First of all, if there was some breach in protocol I made by sharing some preliminary data--

Jonathan Brody
Why didn't you ask me? Why didn't you say, "Look, someone's contacting me. Do you mind if I share some of our data together?"

Anthony Holland
Could I finish without being interrupted?

Jonathan Brody
Yeah.

Anthony Holland
If I broke some protocol, I apologize. You never told me, "Keep this data secret and don't show it to anybody." It just was given freely--

Gabriel Rhodes
Even though Anthony promises he didn't mention Jon's name to these other scientists, if one of those scientists were to do a quick Google search, in a few clicks, he could get to Jon, who would then be associated with data he would never want public.

Anthony Holland
I'm sorry. I mean, to me as a composer, it's like if some violinist says, "Hey, do you have a piece for a violin?" I say, "Well, I have a sketch. It's nothing really great, but I have a little start." "Well, let me see what it is." "Sure. I'll send it along." So it's the same kind of thing. And when people contacted me--

Jonathan Brody
You didn't send it as a sketch, Anthony. You sent them data that is as if we had done the proper controls. That's false advertising.

Anthony Holland
Jonathan, in one case, I met for hours with the director of a medical research hospital in the cancer division. And I explained to this doctor exactly, exactly what we did. She knew it was preliminary. She knew there were holes and things that had to be nailed down. She knew all the details of everything, looked at the data, and said, "Yeah, let's go. Here's a seven-page contract." So I'm just saying--

Jonathan Brody
I just wanted to be part of the conversation.

Anthony Holland
You asked me to respond. No scientist would take my preliminary data seriously. I'm sorry, that's wrong. And I think you need to make up your mind. Either this preliminary data I have is not worthy of another scientist's consideration, or you're mad at me for showing it to another scientist who considered it worthy.

Jonathan Brody
It's not. Anthony, we've had discussions. And you were mostly concerned about--

Gabriel Rhodes
Finally, Jon and Anthony asked for time to talk alone with no microphone. After a while, they made up. But it doesn't seem like they're going to be working together anytime soon. What it felt like to sit in that room, it felt like watching a couple break up, which I felt more sad about than I'd expected to. They were this odd pair it was fun to root for.

And on top of that, I just felt like, [BLEEP] cancer. Anthony's father died of cancer. Jon's aunt died of cancer. My mom died of cancer. Why can't we just get rid of this already? I think out of the three of us, only Jon, who deals with it every day, had realistic expectations when he started these experiments with Anthony.

Jonathan Brody
Even if you have a good idea, even if you have a potential sci-fi cure, it's just not that easy. But if we want scientific breakthroughs, this is what it takes.

Gabriel Rhodes
We are trying to have breakthroughs. We're just not succeeding most of the time.

Ira Glass
Gabriel Rhodes. He's going to continue filming Anthony and Jon if either of them ever starts this research again. You can see clips from what he's filmed so far at thecuredocumentary.com.

Coming up, trying something crazy, throwing a Hail Mary pass to solve a tough problem in your own personal life. A true story. That's in a minute, from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International, when our program continues.

Act Two. Benny Takes a Jet.

Ira Glass
It's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. Each week on our show, of course, we choose a theme, bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show, So Crazy It Just Might Work, stories of people trying a risky thing that nobody ever tries. And that is for a good reason.

We have arrived at Act Two of our show. Act Two, Benny Takes a Jet. So Benny was 23 in Utah. And he would want you to know, before you hear anything else in this story, that he knows that he was an immature 23, because he was gay and a Mormon, which meant that he did not admit to others or himself that he was gay. So he was utterly unused to how to handle a crush, which is what this story is about, a crush.

The crushee is 18 and Mormon. And Benny met him when he came in for a job interview. In retrospect, Benny says, he was obviously straight. Though at the job interview--

Benny
He was flirtatious with me in that he wanted the job really bad. So he was very complimentary towards me. He kept telling me, "You're, like, the coolest guy I've ever interviewed with my entire life. You're so cool. You're the kind of guy that everybody wants to hang out with. And you've got this energy kind of emulating." And I was just-- I was so taken by him. And he had these long, black eyelashes and these blue eyes. And I was just all gawking at him.

Ira Glass
Really? Tell me everything you remember about stuff he said and stuff you said.

Benny
I remember saying to him, "You know, this isn't just a normal retail company. When people come through the door, it's very important to get intimate and just, like, lock eyes with people and make them feel-- like, really seduce them." And he's like, "Kind of like I'm seducing you right now?" And keep in mind, this boy is hopelessly straight. However, I was interpreting it the way I wanted it to go.

And I remember, he kept doing that little-- every time it would be like a touche moment, he would reach over and hit me, kind of-- "Yeah, bro," kind of hit me on the knee. And it was making me crazy.

Ira Glass
Oh, he touched you.

Benny
Several times.

Ira Glass
So you hire him for this job. And then he's working there at the company. And how often would you see him?

Benny
Well, I traveled Monday through Thursday. And then, once I hired him, I found myself finding all these excuses and reasons why I needed to be back in Utah. Oh, there's a big HR meltdown with this at this store. And I think there's a lot of theft problems, that we're having control issues at this store. Someone would give me one little thing, and I would come roaring back on a one-way ticket to Salt Lake City.

Ira Glass
Was he that cute?

Benny
I don't know what happened. Now that I look back, when I show people pictures of him, if I--

Ira Glass
You have pictures of him?

Benny
Well, I took several pictures of him. His friend, he and I ended up seeing each other. And I said, "Oh, I'm doing this end of the year slide show of all the employees. And oh, I don't have any pictures of him. So is there any possible way that you-- do you have any just lying around?" "Oh my gosh, yes. I have all these pictures of us when we went boating." "Oh, perfect."

So he brings all these pictures. And I end up, of course, picking out all of the shirtless ones. And he never questioned. He'd just, "Oh yeah, this is a good one, too." And I even remember him saying, "This one looks like some Abercrombie shot of him coming out of the water." And I said, "Yeah, I'll take that one, too. I think everyone will like that one."

Ira Glass
And did you use them?

Benny
Actually, I did put a couple of them in the slide show. But then, when I was done, I never gave them back to his friend. I had them, like, stashed all over the place. I mean, at one point, they were in my Book of Mormon, they were in my Bible. I was just such a mess, just a boiling pot of crazy. I look back now, and I still don't even know who that person is, to behave like that.

Ira Glass
And what did you say to yourself at the time? What did you think it was?

Benny
I would never, ever try anything. I would never-- because I always told myself I wasn't gay. But I was struggling with this thing that I didn't know what it was. And maybe other men, young men, struggle with the same thing. And maybe there would be a moment of vulnerability or a moment of confusion for him, where he would be possibly feeling the same thing I was. And maybe, I don't know, a cuddle or a kiss on the cheek or something very minor.

Ira Glass
That's really as far as you would go in your head?

Benny
When I was with him. There were times-- well, it went way further than that, obviously, in my private spaces. Way further, as far as it could possibly go. But then I just felt so horrible. And then, when I would see him, I would feel like I had done these things with him. And then I couldn't look at him. And there was all this guilt. I would then really beat myself up and say, oh, Benny, will you let Satan just get into your body like that and allow that? This is so evil. I would go there. I can't even begin to describe to you how exhausting it was. Coming out was not an option. It was so unfathomable.

Ira Glass
You were Mormon.

Benny
Mormon, and really believed it. I believed it so much that, around this time, there was a gay-straight alliance group at a high school, trying to form in Salt Lake. And I actually went to it to try and fight them off, to get it not to pass to be able to be at this school. I went and rallied there with some other Christians, Mormons. There was a big group.

Ira Glass
To prevent this group from existing.

Benny
Yeah, because I was very dedicated to also killing this, quote, "demon" that was inside of me, that I was told that was-- I had allowed this to come in. I had chosen this. There was no-- and because of the guilt--

Ira Glass
And when you were trying to prevent this group from starting up, did you feel like you were doing other people a favor? Or was it not even--

Benny
Mm-hmm. That was my redemption in what I was behaving like, thinking about guys, going into chat rooms. Any of those things that I was doing on the side, I felt, in the greater scope of things, that I was carrying the banner of God.

Ira Glass
Anyway, back to the crush. Soon enough, the 18-year-old turns 19 and gets called on a Mormon mission to Peru, which means that he'll be gone for two full years.

Benny
I was absolutely devastated. I went to his farewell. And his parents were all about, "Oh, he loves you so much. You're the greatest boss," yada, yada. Of course, you know how I took all of that. I'm just filing it in crazy town.

Ira Glass
The 19-year-old leaves. Benny stews for six months, driving his best friend Parker nuts with all of his obsessing. Parker, by the way, in this story, seems like the greatest guy in the world-- straight, Mormon, but understanding Benny better than Benny was understanding himself at the time. And it is with Parker, at 2:00 in the morning, that Benny comes up with his idea that is so crazy that it might just work.

Benny
I said, "We should go visit him in Peru." And Parker says, "You know what, Benny, let's go. Let's go. Let's go visit him. Yeah, let's go see him." And I said, "I'm serious. I will book the tickets tonight. And he said, "OK."

Ira Glass
Benny then goes to the 19-year-old's parents and says that he's taking a vacation to Peru. Would they want him to bring a package or something from the family, maybe? Seems like a nice offer. They say, of course. Everybody agrees to make it a surprise for the 19-year-old, more fun that way. So Benny and Parker fly to Peru, make their way to the remote mountain town where the 19-year-old was now a missionary. They wander around asking people, where is the Mormon church in town?

Benny
I ended up-- someone said, "Oh yes, we know where the Mormoni" or whatever they called it. They said, "Yeah, we know where the Mormons are." And so they told us where the chapel was. And we got to the chapel. And these elders were just, oh, my gosh. They're yelling through the church, "Oh, my gosh. Buddy from Utah is here. And, oh, my gosh, you just showed up. Like, who does that? That's the coolest thing. Dude, how expensive were those tickets?" It turns into to this big--

Ira Glass
Did you feel guilty at all?

Benny
Oh, my gosh. I felt, once I was there in the chapel and this started happening, all of a sudden, this very dark cloud came over me of, boy, you are messing with fire, because now, you're in the Lord's house, and you are waiting for this boy that you are crushing just obsessively over. And I started to become very uncomfortable.

And then, all of a sudden, one of the elders came. They said, "He's here." I felt as if I was going to puke. And then he came in. He walked right in. And when he walked in, he stopped in his tracks, and he's, "No way." And he just dropped all of his books. And he just, "What?" And he ran over to me, and he just grabbed me and hugged me so tight. It was so tight and so-- And he was like, "What are you doing here?" And Parker is friends with him. So Parker's like, "Hey, dude." Parker's going along with this ridiculous, cockamamie thing that I have done.

And he called his mission president or someone and said, "I have friends from Salt Lake City that are traveling through Peru." He got permission or something to come and take time with us. And so it's, like, 7:30 at night now. It's getting dark.

And freakin' Parker, he's like, "OK, I'm gonna--" And if you know anything about missionaries, you can't be away from your companion that's with you, can't separate from each other, ever, unless you're going to the bathroom. So Parker's like, "I'm gonna distract him enough, where we're in a conversation, where you can at least get a good 50 feet away from us, where he can still see you so it won't look weird. And you can spend some time with him and just talk to him, see how his mission's going."

So him and I sat on the steps of this cathedral. And I said, "How's the mission going?" And he started telling me. And then he just starts to cry. And then he says, "I feel like you're an answer to my prayer, because I have been struggling so much here." My heart is ready to beat out of my bloody body. I mean, it's just--

Ira Glass
This is your reaction.

Benny
I remember the pulse that was happening. It almost hurt.

Ira Glass
Because he said that, you're the answer to my prayer.

Benny
Yeah. And then he said, "I've been struggling." I said, "Listen. I've been on a mission. I know what that feels like. I have been here. I know how confusing and difficult and lonely it can be." And he said, "I just can't believe you came here." And then he said, "This has got to be the coolest thing anyone has ever done for me, to just come here and do something this, for you to come and see me." And then he said, "Wow, Benny, I feel so much happiness seeing you. And you are that kind of person that has always filled me with joy and hope. And every time I'm around you, I want to be better."

And then I just said, "Well, you know, I love you a lot." And he said, "I love you, too." And then it was like Tourette's. I couldn't even help myself. And I just said, "No. I love you." And then he kind of tilted his head. And he looked at me, and he said, "I love you, too, bro." I saw in his face, the way he looked at me.

And then, my eyes are starting to fill up with tears. I'm starting to panic. All of this that I've held inside of me is crumbling. Quivering lip, the whole puppy face, I can't even imagine what he was seeing. And Parker-- I look over. Parker, I see him in the background with his hand like, "cut it" to his neck. He just was looking at me like, "Benny, cut it." He was watching the body language. He could see what was unfolding. He was like, "Benny, just cut it."

And actually, this guy, he knew I had deviated from "I love you, bro." And then he's like, "You know, we gotta go. It's getting really dark." And I was crushed, because in that moment, it was like I'd been asleep and someone had woken me up.

And all of a sudden-- we were walking away, and I said to Parker, "He's straight, isn't he?" And Parker said, "Benny, yes. He is." And I just went crazy and started yelling at Parker. "How could you let me do this? You were supposed to be my voice of reason! You're my best friend! I confided in you in this! This is your fault! You put these thoughts in my head!" And I was so angry, I just started screaming at him in the middle of the street.

And I was bawling like a crazy person and just saying, "What is this feeling?" And he's like, "Benny, you're feeling crushed, like you're heart's breaking." He's like, "This is good. You're supposed to feel this. It's a little late." And I'm like, "Don't tell me how to feel! I want to go home. I don't even want to stay in Peru anymore." And Parker just sat.

And I said, "Tell me this. Have you known all along that this was going to happen?" He goes, "Well, to be honest, I didn't know you were going to do that. But of course I knew he was straight. I tried to tell you one time. You got a little weird about it. And I just decided in my head, Benny needs to experience this." I cried for hours. And Parker was just listening to me.

And then he was the one that said, "You imagine, Benny, feeling this but having someone reciprocating it." And I said, "You mean, with a gay guy?" And he said, "Well, yeah, because that's the only guy that's going to do that with you." And then it was this journey to coming out of the closet. That was what cracked it opened, you know?

Ira Glass
Benny now lives in New York City. He has a boyfriend.
