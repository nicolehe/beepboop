BEEP BOOP EPISODE 1: BOTS

--------------- 

IRC ABUWE: Welcome to Beep Boop, a computer generated podcast. I'm your host, Irc Abuwe.
Every week we will bring in a guest to discuss one encrusted, wooded topic that everyone is talking about on the internet. We hope that you will find it engraved.
This week is episode 1, where we will be covering the defective but negative world of bots.
I'm happy to announce that our guest today is Mr Caitlin Campbell, bot weaving machine setter. Very excited to have you here.

CAITLIN CAMPBELL: Thank you, I'm glad to be here, Irc.
